# Contributing to ShardTelemetry

Thank you for helping improve ShardTelemetry.

## Development

ShardTelemetry uses the Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. A change is
ready for review when these commands pass:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets --all-features
cargo build --workspace --all-targets --release
```

Add regression tests for behavioral changes. Storage-format, recovery, query,
and protocol changes require malformed-input and restart-boundary coverage.
Benchmark claims must include the command, corpus identity, machine, CPU
allocation, build profile, and verification mode.
