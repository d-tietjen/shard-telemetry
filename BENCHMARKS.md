# Compression benchmark results

## Current stock-ClickHouse compatibility evidence — 2026-08-06

The supported ClickHouse integration contains no C++ adapter or custom
ClickHouse build. The Rust scan endpoint streams RowBinary into the stock
ClickHouse `URL` engine. The retained Adam acceptance run passed 30/30 exact
result cases against the unmodified official `26.3.17.56` image: 18 log cases
and 12 span, event, link, metric, exemplar, and cross-signal cases.

```text
/home/dtietjen/deterministic-sim-runs/shard-telemetry/clickhouse-stock-url-20260806-v1/acceptance-3-26.3
```

This is functional SQL compatibility evidence, not a URL-table latency claim.
Stock ClickHouse cannot infer arbitrary SQL predicates into URL parameters, so
performance-sensitive callers use ShardTelemetry's Rust APIs and indexes
directly or supply explicit scan parameters.

## Historical retained evidence — 2026-08-04

The current evidence root on Adam is:

```text
/home/dtietjen/deterministic-sim-runs/shard-telemetry/clickhouse-adapter-20260804-v1
```

These are sequential native-Linux performance runs with pinned binaries,
corpus hashes, CPU affinity, exact-result checksums, and retained failed
attempts. They are not deterministic-simulation replay claims.

The directory name predates removal of the C++ ClickHouse prototype. Storage,
compression, native-query, and ingestion measurements remain valid. Results
whose query path explicitly used `StorageShardTelemetry` are historical
prototype evidence and are not release evidence for the supported stock
ClickHouse URL boundary.

The historical custom ClickHouse query node was built from exact tag
`v26.3.17.56-lts`, commit
`c57540de480d8a501b601163471d3843674378cf`, using the official pinned
builder. Its retired automatic-pushdown path passed 30/30 exact-result
cases: 18 log cases, nine signal-relation cases, and three cross-signal joins.

### Authoritative full 80 GiB log head-to-head

`benchmark-80g-final-attempt3` consumed the complete immutable corpus on
2026-08-05 UTC. Both engines received exactly 85,899,345,920 source bytes and
produced 607,363,459 rows after independently rejecting the same eight
malformed JSON lines. They ran sequentially on physical CPUs 0–15 after the
same prewarm. ClickHouse ingestion used newline-safe `LineAsString`,
`isValidJSON`, and one tuple `JSONExtract`; this avoids allowing one malformed
brace to unbalance ClickHouse's parallel `JSONEachRow` segmenter. Nanosecond
timestamps were parsed explicitly at `DateTime64(9, 'UTC')` precision.

| Engine | Stored bytes | Ratio | Ingest | Relative result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| **ShardTelemetry** | **2,702,973,946** | **31.78x** | 148.60 MiB/s | 2.25x smaller |
| ClickHouse MergeTree | 6,091,870,726 | 14.10x | **234.80 MiB/s** | 1.58x faster ingest |

ShardTelemetry used 55.63% fewer durable bytes. Its directory measurement
includes the complete durable store; ClickHouse's comparison measurement is
`bytes_on_disk` across all active table parts and therefore includes its text
index. ClickHouse reported 1,172,206,269 compressed column bytes, but total
active-part storage was 6,091,870,726 bytes once indexes, marks, checksums, and
part metadata were included. The ShardTelemetry retained-payload metric was
2,700,065,308 bytes; its total directory was 2,702,973,946 bytes.

Twenty warm, single-client iterations were run through the same pinned
ClickHouse query process after one unmeasured warmup. Every 100-row ordered
result was byte-identical between the automatic ShardTelemetry adapter and the
native MergeTree table.

| Query | ShardTelemetry p50 / p99 | ClickHouse p50 / p99 | Winner at p50 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Latest 100 records | **70 / 82 ms** | 767 / 807 ms | ShardTelemetry, 10.96x |
| Exact `docker_stream=stderr` | 69 / 76 ms | **6 / 6 ms** | ClickHouse, 11.50x |
| Case-insensitive token `cannot` | **100 / 123 ms** | 1,715 / 1,833 ms | ShardTelemetry, 17.15x |

The exact-stream loss is the clearest remaining query-index priority:
ClickHouse's `(stream, time)` ordering makes that top-k lookup nearly direct,
while the current adapter still pays metadata-posting and merge overhead.
ShardTelemetry's timestamp directory and compressed-domain term index win the
latest and token cases. The full live ingestion path remains far below the
separate 1 GiB/s-per-core objective; that objective is not claimed here.

### Isolated single-partition server path — 2026-08-05

This is a server-owner measurement, not a claim that the entire machine used
one core. The ShardTelemetry server was pinned to physical CPU 0, while the
16-worker native loader was pinned to CPUs 1-15. The server used one physical
owner stripe and the fixed homogeneous route sent every append to one logical
partition. The immutable corpus was prewarmed before each run; the source was
the same ClickHouse Docker JSON corpus used above:

```text
source=/home/dtietjen/log-compression-samples/clickhouse-docker-json-error-loop-tail-80g-20260729.log
sha256=4fd6379bd89fcb44688a3ebd611729416c82f110fbf49ffef905d9df0ebf0508
```

The baseline was the valid current native path before the transient-index
handoff. The optimized path keeps the same durable `STEL`/`SLW1` bytes but
adds an `SLT1` process-local index context to the native request. The owner
stripe uses that context instead of decompressing the structural frame to
recover its already-built index. The native server also avoids re-encoding and
re-decoding an already validated batch, and the one-partition store path skips
multi-partition dispatch setup.

| Run | Source prefix | Records | Native wire bytes | Durable bytes | Source throughput | Server cycles | Server instructions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Baseline | 2 GiB | 15,184,074 | 67,674,722 | 67,761,920 | 994.92 MiB/s | 2,621,965,327 | 3,264,718,379 |
| Optimized | 2 GiB | 15,184,074 | 77,273,224 | 67,761,920 | **1,021.87 MiB/s** | **2,020,851,787** | **2,706,718,919** |
| Change | identical | identical | +14.2% transient bytes | **0%** | **+2.7%** | **-22.9%** | **-17.1%** |

The transient index context increases request bytes but does not enter the
durable store or object tier. Both runs had zero CPU migrations. The optimized
4-GiB confirmation sustained 1,006.67 MiB/s versus 976.39 MiB/s for the prior
path, with durable bytes unchanged at 135,518,896. Short runs vary with shared
host scheduling, so the 4-GiB result is the preferred throughput comparison.

The remaining owner-core profile is dominated by TCP receive/send and
shard-stream WAL/page-cache work. Structural encoding remains producer-side:
moving it to the single owner would trade away the existing multi-core
producer throughput rather than remove a server bottleneck.

### Real-log controlled 1 GiB run

`benchmark-1g-attempt13` consumed exactly 1,073,741,933 accepted source bytes
and 7,592,023 valid Docker JSON log records from the immutable 80 GiB corpus.
Both engines used CPUs 0–15 sequentially and returned byte-identical results
for latest, stream-filtered, and case-insensitive token queries.

| Engine | Stored bytes | Ratio | Ingest | Relative result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| **ShardTelemetry** | **33,958,025** | **31.62x** | **123.20 MiB/s** | 2.25x smaller, 1.78x faster |
| ClickHouse MergeTree | 76,288,534 | 14.07x | 69.14 MiB/s | baseline |

The direct ShardTelemetry HTTP p50 values were approximately 25 ms for latest
and stream lookups and 38 ms for a case-insensitive token lookup. Through the
ClickHouse adapter/query node, ShardTelemetry p50 values were 51, 49, and
74 ms respectively versus ClickHouse MergeTree's 16, 4, and 32 ms. The live
protocol path therefore does **not** yet satisfy the 1 GiB/s-per-core target;
123.20 MiB/s is the measured aggregate result for this run.

### Native ingress ablation — Adam, 2 GiB

`ingress-direct-view-2g-attempt1` used the same 16 physical CPUs, source
prefix, prewarm, native protocol, and one malformed-line condition as the
earlier ingress smoke runs. The current path keeps the borrowed `serde_json`
Docker parser, caches the repeated Docker metadata, emits one source-cohort
structural group, and writes directly through `StructuralRecordView` instead
of first constructing one `OtlpLogEvent` per record.

| Path | Source MiB/s | Records | Wire bytes | Stored bytes | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Previous native baseline | 133.09 | 15,184,074 | 67,674,722 | 67,808,000 | reference |
| Borrowed parser + metadata fast path | 135.36 | 15,184,074 | 67,674,722 | 67,808,000 | superseded |
| **Direct structural view + single cohort** | **135.83** | 15,184,074 | 67,674,722 | 67,808,000 | **current** |
| SIMD `sonic-rs` parser candidate | 134.30 | 15,184,074 | 67,674,722 | 67,808,000 | rejected |

The direct-view change improves the measured native loader by 2.06% over the
baseline without changing bytes or reconstruction. The ClickHouse control in
the same direct-view harness measured 192.48 MiB/s and 152,459,902 stored
bytes. Ingress remains the only measured full-corpus throughput category where
ClickHouse is ahead; the SIMD parser candidate was removed because it regressed
the direct-view result. Retained evidence is under:

```

### Retired projected-RowBinary prototype head-to-head — Adam, 2 GiB

`clickhouse-query-optimization-20260805-v1/attempt13-rowbinary-projected-schema-2g`
used CPUs 0–15 sequentially and the exact 2,147,483,681-byte accepted source
prefix. Both engines returned 15,184,074 records. This run validates the
adapter-level subset capability required to keep ClickHouse's positional
RowBinary parser aligned with ShardTelemetry's projected response.

| Engine | Stored bytes | Ratio | Durable ingest | Relative result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| **ShardTelemetry** | **67,808,000** | **31.67x** | **957.44 MiB/s** | 2.25x smaller, 5.11x faster |
| ClickHouse MergeTree | 152,459,902 | 14.09x | 187.20 MiB/s | baseline |

All latest, exact-stream, and indexed-token result files were byte-identical.
The warm query results below used 20 measured iterations after prewarming.

| Query | ShardTelemetry p50/p99 | ClickHouse p50/p99 | Remaining gap |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Latest 100 | 61/70 ms | **27/29 ms** | 2.26x p50 |
| Exact stream, latest 100 | 59/66 ms | **4/5 ms** | 14.75x p50 |
| Indexed token, latest 100 | 92/106 ms | **51/59 ms** | 1.80x p50 |

This closed the prototype's RowBinary trivial-count correctness failure and
demonstrates the ingress/storage improvement. Its query timings are historical;
the supported stock URL boundary must be measured separately. The native pack
timings above remain direct storage-index measurements.

### Traces and metrics, one core

`clickhouse-query-optimization-20260805-v1/attempt5-owner-fast` used 262,144
deterministic correlated records per signal on CPU 0. The same trace and metric
rows were inserted into an isolated ClickHouse 26.5.1.882 container pinned by
image digest. The per-signal rows below measure the signal-native durable
payload and auxiliary bytes; the complete restarted ShardTelemetry server
directory was 6,612,008 bytes for both signals, versus 9,636,264 bytes across
the two ClickHouse table parts.

| Signal | Engine | Canonical bytes | Stored bytes | Ratio | Encode |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Traces | **ShardTelemetry** | 107,609,736 | **902,077** | **119.29x** | **258.31 MiB/s** |
| Traces | ClickHouse | 107,609,736 | 5,753,460 | 18.70x | 108.03 MiB/s |
| Metrics | **ShardTelemetry** | 126,451,328 | **1,966,452** | **64.30x** | **604.32 MiB/s** |
| Metrics | ClickHouse | 126,451,328 | 3,882,804 | 32.57x | 119.40 MiB/s |

Server-facing queries used ClickHouse `RowBinary` on both sides and the same
pinned ClickHouse client/evaluator process. Each class ran for 2,000 warm
iterations after an untimed warmup.

| Server-facing query | Rows | ShardTelemetry QPS | ClickHouse QPS | ShardTelemetry advantage |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Exact trace ID | 8 | **501.562** | 302.827 | **1.66x** |
| Exact metric series | 2,048 | **321.999** | 283.734 | **1.13x** |
| Resource attribute, limit 1,000 | 1,000 | **276.269** | 190.069 | **1.45x** |

Every ordered result file was byte-identical. The optimization removes generic
row materialization from narrow scans, writes projected span/metric lanes
directly as RowBinary, keeps a bounded append-only resource index with lazy
ordering, and avoids a second metric conflict-resolution/fingerprint pass after
the owning `MetricStripe` has already selected winners. The previous 77 ms
metric-series and 828 ms resource-scan p50 losses are therefore closed.

### Current cold-tier microbenchmark

`cold-tier-1core-attempt1` used one 64 MiB local immutable object, 64 adjacent
64 KiB ranges, a 4 MiB verified cache chunk, and 100 one-core iterations.

| Path | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Batched first cold read | 18,958.367 us |
| Batched warm query | **1.760 us** |
| Independent warm query | 6,888.821 us |
| Parsed catalog control lookup | **0.687 us** |
| Raw cached catalog decode | 11.149 us |
| Absent correlation pruned at catalog root | **0.033 us** |

Both cold implementations fetched exactly 4 MiB from the source and verified
the immutable bytes. The root-pruned correlation performed no payload read.
This is a local object-store/cache ablation, not an S3 network-latency claim.

The smaller run is retained as a controlled startup-sensitive comparison; the
full result above is authoritative for capacity planning. A retained failed
80 GiB attempt exposed a 1,024 soft descriptor limit after opening 1,001
shard-stream pack readers. The corrected harness records a 262,144 soft limit,
and shard-stream's on-demand pack-reader patch has a passing 81-pack
recovery/fetch test. ShardTelemetry must pin that dependency fix before a
production release; the raised benchmark limit is not the production fix.

## Logs, traces, metrics, and correlation — local v1 storage run (2026-08-04)

`shard-telemetry-signal-bench` generates one deterministic, correlated
production-like corpus for all three signals. Every signal shares exact typed
resource and scope metadata; logs and spans share trace/span IDs; metric
exemplars use the same link model. It measures the sole pre-release v1 format:

- logs use the structural storage codec and its embedded lookup index;
- traces use bounded 8 MiB multi-trace columnar blocks;
- metrics use per-series chunks;
- trace and metric stored bytes include their serialized cold-correlation
  filters.

The current storage-inclusive run used an Apple M5 Max, 32,768 records per
signal, and 2,000 warm lookup iterations. Encode throughput includes codec and
cold-filter construction; log encode also includes structural indexing.

| Signal | Canonical bytes | Payload bytes | Auxiliary bytes | Stored bytes | Ratio | Encode | Decode |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Logs | 29,773,336 | 446,851 | 0 | 446,851 | **66.63x** | 224.33 MiB/s | 1,297.90 MiB/s |
| Traces | 13,371,009 | 112,481 | 604 | 113,085 | **118.24x** | 465.97 MiB/s | 2,789.85 MiB/s |
| Metrics | 15,756,928 | 298,047 | 31,650 | 329,697 | **47.79x** | 814.35 MiB/s | 2,365.99 MiB/s |

| Lookup path | Results/page | Lookups/s | p50 | p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Log term + exact metadata | 100 | 231,159 | 4.25 us | 5.21 us |
| Trace ID | 8 | 1,683,502 | 0.54 us | 0.71 us |
| Exact metric series | 100 | 527,073 | 1.88 us | 2.13 us |
| Resource + typed-label correlation | 1,000 | 156,597 | 6.33 us | 7.00 us |

An earlier codec-only ablation omitted block grouping, structural log storage,
and cold-correlation bytes. It reported 25.41x logs, 68.98x traces, and 47.20x
metrics on the same 32,768-record corpus. Those figures remain useful for
isolating codec changes but are superseded by the storage-inclusive table for
capacity planning.

These are deterministic synthetic storage/index results, not Adam production
capture or competitor claims. The existing 80 GiB Adam log result below remains
the authoritative real-log gate. Retained 16 GiB trace and metric captures are
still required before publishing Tempo and Prometheus head-to-head claims.

### Adam single-core synthetic lookup and storage codec

The exact public commit `bdcb1c84e37fa3d9d24f097106bbb002a850c0c2`
was prewarmed once and measured three times on physical CPU 0 of Adam's AMD
Ryzen 9 3950X. The table reports the median of the three runs; every run used
32,768 records per signal and 2,000 lookup iterations.

| Signal | Stored bytes | Ratio | Encode | Decode | Lookups/s | p50 / p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Logs | 1,188,990 | 25.04x | 88.37 MiB/s | 173.39 MiB/s | 23,757 | 41.74 / 48.11 us |
| Traces | 195,125 | 68.53x | 286.48 MiB/s | 1,091.95 MiB/s | 17,608 | 57.06 / 66.06 us |
| Metrics | 317,492 | 46.64x | 707.65 MiB/s | 1,632.68 MiB/s | 1,683 | 591.87 / 627.48 us |
| Resource + typed-label correlation | — | — | — | — | 1,765 | 558.85 / 699.02 us |

The process consumed one CPU and had a median peak RSS of 191,992 KiB. This
path intentionally includes rich typed metadata, index construction, and cold
filters; it does not meet the separate 1 GiB/s-per-core target for logs or
traces. Metrics exceed 1 GiB/s on the Apple development host but reach 707.65
MiB/s on Adam. These measurements identify CPU work rather than hiding it
behind aggregate multi-core throughput.

### Adam traces and metrics versus ClickHouse — 2026-08-04

The exact public revision
`b05123a60104eb54c463f9f63d52a76f8e0109e0` was compared with ClickHouse
26.5.1.882 three times sequentially on physical CPU 0. Each run used the same
deterministic 262,144-record corpus per signal and 2,000 warm lookup
iterations. The tables report medians.

ClickHouse stored typed query columns plus the complete lossless MessagePack
record in Zstandard-1 columns. ShardTelemetry stored its signal-native payload,
cold-correlation filters, and durable frame lengths. Both timed storage paths
wrote their output and synchronized it before stopping the timer. ClickHouse
used an isolated one-core MergeTree container with
`fsync_after_insert = 1`; ShardTelemetry wrote one framed pack per signal and
called `sync_all`.

| Signal | Engine | Canonical bytes | Durable bytes | Ratio | Durable encode |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Traces | **ShardTelemetry** | 107,609,736 | **1,558,432** | **69.05x** | **268.55 MiB/s** |
| Traces | ClickHouse | 107,609,736 | 5,753,460 | 18.70x | 103.66 MiB/s |
| Metrics | **ShardTelemetry** | 126,451,328 | **2,244,829** | **56.33x** | **596.09 MiB/s** |
| Metrics | ClickHouse | 126,451,328 | 3,882,804 | 32.57x | 110.64 MiB/s |

ShardTelemetry used 72.91% fewer bytes and encoded 2.59x faster for traces. It
used 42.19% fewer bytes and encoded 5.39x faster for metrics. The metric corpus
contains exactly 128 series with 2,048 points each, so every series stays below
the production 4,096-point chunk bound.

| Warm lookup | Results | ShardTelemetry ops/s | ShardTelemetry p50 / p99 | ClickHouse ops/s | ClickHouse p50 / p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Trace ID | 8 | **700,272.02** | **0.00138 / 0.00140 ms** | 338.36 | 2 / 6 ms |
| Exact metric series | 100 | **12,297.18** | **0.080 / 0.124 ms** | 267.40 | 3 / 9 ms |

ShardTelemetry completed 2,069.59x more trace-ID lookups and 45.99x more exact
metric-series lookups per second. Its trace p50 was 1,449x lower and its metric
p50 was 37.44x lower. The ShardTelemetry measurements use the native Rust query
API; ClickHouse uses one persistent `clickhouse-benchmark` client/server
connection, whose percentile output is quantized to milliseconds. This is an
engine-boundary comparison, not a same-wire-protocol claim.

The improvement was profile-guided. The baseline revision recomputed a full
series fingerprint for every decoded metric point, materialized every metric
chunk before applying the result limit, scanned every trace head and resident
trace block for an exact ID, and cloned the smallest complete correlation
posting before intersecting and truncating it. The current paths instead use:

- direct exact-series and exact-trace ownership lookups;
- timestamp-ordered metric chunk pruning with conflict-safe cutoff;
- trace-directory fragment pushdown into block-ID-keyed resident storage;
- one identity check per exact metric series rather than one per point; and
- bounded streaming correlation intersection with monotonic posting cursors.

On the same 262,144-record corpus and 10,000 iterations, the profile workload
fell from approximately 1.361 trillion to 72.36 billion sampled CPU cycles, a
94.68% reduction, with zero lost samples. Metric lookup improved from a
three-run median of 178.88 to 12,297.18 operations per second. Cross-signal
correlation improved from 35.46 to 98,596.33 operations per second while
retaining its 1,000-reference page and exact ordering.

The final profile's largest self-costs are now the log hot-posting collector
(9.25%), BLAKE3 canonical hashing (6.58%), correlation ingestion (5.81%), and
hot log matching (3.78%). Metric decoding is 0.57% self time, and neither
exact trace lookup nor metric lookup remains a leading flat hotspot. The next
optimization work should therefore target limit-aware log-posting iteration
and cached immutable resource, scope, attribute, and series identities rather
than changing the trace or metric compression codecs.

Before timing, ClickHouse returned the selected trace and the complete
2,048-point metric series as byte-identical MessagePack. All three runs produced
the same corpus hashes and query-result hashes. Cross-signal correlation is not
claimed as a ClickHouse comparison because the current ClickHouse query covers
only one table, while the ShardTelemetry operation follows resource, typed
attribute, trace, span-link, and exemplar postings across all three signals.

### Profile-guided hot lookup and cold-tier reads — 2026-08-04

Revision `ed9f0971dc19f3e719641f723d1294b603b08088` was prewarmed once and
measured three times sequentially on Adam physical CPU 0. The hot comparison
uses the retained `b05123a60104eb54c463f9f63d52a76f8e0109e0` runs above with
the same 262,144 records per signal and 2,000 lookup iterations.

| Lookup | `b05123a` median | `ed9f097` median | Change | Current p50 / p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Log term + exact metadata, limit 100 | 3,702.64/s | **81,787.94/s** | **22.09x** | **12.12 / 16.05 us** |
| Trace ID | 700,272.02/s | 699,046.74/s | -0.18% | 1.38 / 1.40 us |
| Exact metric series | 12,297.18/s | 12,227.66/s | -0.57% | 79.01 / 133.04 us |
| Cross-signal correlation | 98,596.33/s | 98,533.71/s | -0.06% | 10.06 / 13.47 us |

The log query now streams the shortest resident posting, checks the remaining
postings by run membership, and stops after the requested offset-ordered page.
It no longer materializes every match before truncating. Stored bytes and the
25.02x log ratio are byte-identical to the baseline. The other lookup paths
remain within normal run-to-run variance.

The comparable 10,000-iteration `perf` workload fell from approximately
72.36 billion to 49.84 billion sampled cycles, a **31.13% reduction**, with
zero lost samples. `HotPostingList::collect_in` (formerly 9.25% self cost) and
hot log matching (formerly 3.78%) no longer appear above the 0.5% reporting
threshold. BLAKE3 fell from 6.58% to 2.56% after bounded exact-identity caches;
correlation posting insertion is now the largest flat target at 9.56%.

Cold object-tier reads were measured separately with 64 adjacent 64 KiB block
ranges inside one 4 MiB immutable payload chunk. Each run used a new object and
new caches; one cold query was followed by ten warm queries.

| Path | Independent range reads | Batched range read | Ratio of medians |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Cold latency | 416,955.97 us | **25,756.76 us** | **16.19x** |
| Warm latency/query | 374,601.71 us | **5,813.08 us** | **64.44x** |

Both implementations fetched exactly one 4 MiB chunk from object storage. The
independent path loaded that chunk 704 times across the cold and warm phases;
the batched path loaded it 11 times. Production queries now use the batched
path for selected log frames, trace blocks, and metric chunks. Catalog pages,
group manifests, query/recovery indexes, and payload ranges are all cached and
checksum-verified. Control/index data has a separate 8 GiB default cache, so a
payload scan cannot evict it from the 512 GiB payload cache.

The standalone cold benchmark is reproducible with:

```bash
taskset -c 0 target/release/shard-telemetry-tier-cache-bench --iterations 10

### Second profile pass: metric lookup, encoding, and object controls — 2026-08-04

Revision `6ea8ca645225ac6476a241767c1e489c2bf88dd1` was built from a clean
bundle checkout, prewarmed, and measured three times sequentially on Adam
physical CPU 0. Each signal run used 262,144 records and 2,000 lookup
iterations. The table reports medians.

| Signal | Stored bytes | Ratio | Encode MiB/s | Lookup/s | p50 / p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Logs | 9,523,630 | 25.02x | **94.29** | 78,681.74 | 12.63 / 16.31 us |
| Traces | 1,558,224 | 69.06x | 269.11 | 700,875.22 | 1.38 / 1.41 us |
| Metrics | 2,242,781 | 56.38x | 622.73 | **169,598.60** | 5.91 / 5.99 us |
| Cross-signal correlation | — | — | — | 98,249.85 | 10.07 / 13.63 us |

The exact-series metric path is now 13.87x faster than the retained
`ed9f097` median of 12,227.66 lookups/s. It caches bounded decoded immutable
chunks and streams non-overlapping exact-series chunks only until the requested
page is complete. The conflict/overlap path still performs durable-offset
winner arbitration. Log, trace, and correlation lookup remained within 4% of
their retained medians.

Correlation ingestion now resolves each tenant/resource/scope/attribute
identity once per immutable input identity and appends monotonic postings
without a redundant map probe. In the comparable profile, correlation posting
insertion fell from 9.56% to 2.19% self cycles. The final 10,000-iteration
profile captured 11,454 samples and approximately 41.46 billion cycles with
zero lost samples.

Typed OTLP log metadata is serialized directly from borrowed records into the
existing MessagePack lane. A byte-identity test compares mixed plain and fully
typed records—including nested values and NaN payload bits—with the former
owned serializer. On Adam, the retained median log encoding improved from
92.85 to 94.29 MiB/s (+1.55%), while `encode_typed_metadata` fell from 2.28%
to 0.88% inclusive profile cycles (-61.40%). All three stored signal sizes
above are identical to the prior implementation.

The object cache now retains verified immutable payload chunks as shared
`Arc` slices, avoiding a copy for ranges contained in one chunk. Catalog pages
and group manifests have a separate, conservatively accounted parsed-object
budget. Group and page catalog entries also carry union correlation filters,
allowing absent resource/scope/attribute/trace correlations to fail before a
manifest or payload read. Primary trace-ID ranges and linked-trace filters are
combined fail-open, so collisions only add work.

| Adam CPU-0 cold-path ablation | Median latency | Comparison |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Batched cold 64 × 64 KiB ranges | 16,500.83 us | one 4 MiB source read |
| Batched warm ranges | **1.786 us** | 3,254.80x faster than the former 5,813.08 us path |
| Raw cached page + manifest decode | 11.222 us | baseline |
| Parsed page + manifest cache | **0.691 us** | **16.24x faster** |
| Absent correlation rejected by catalog root | **0.035 us** | **19.74x faster** than parsed control traversal; zero payload reads |

The cold first read remains bounded by loading and verifying the same 4 MiB
source chunk; the optimization targets repeated warm reads and petabyte-scale
catalog traversal. The standalone tier benchmark now reports payload-copy,
parsed-control, and catalog-correlation ablations in one run.

The deterministic-simulation framework checkout on Adam was dirty, so these
are clean product-revision, native pinned measurements rather than an exact
task-schedule replay campaign.

### Signal-native storage layout pass — 2026-08-04

Revision `34a8b6fe8bb5120ce71b20a4f40fdb4dc4ecffc8` changes only the single
pre-release format. It removes repeated semantic values before compression
rather than asking Zstandard to rediscover them:

- typed logs use block dictionaries for exact OTLP bodies, attribute sets,
  resources, scopes, severity text, and event names; a string body equal to
  the indexed message and canonical trace/span ID fields are referenced rather
  than stored twice; observed time is stored as a wrapping delta from event
  time;
- trace IDs are stored once per contiguous sorted trace, and parent IDs use
  exact previous-span or first-span references when those topologies apply;
- periodic metric timestamp delta-of-delta values use bounded runs, and the
  bit-exact floating-point lane reuses the previous Gorilla XOR window.

Every fallback remains inline and lossless. Attribute order, absent versus
empty values, arbitrary timestamp bit patterns, NaN payload bits, unknown OTLP
flags, nonlocal trace parents, and high-cardinality values reconstruct exactly.

The following table compares three-run Adam CPU-0 medians with the retained
`6ea8ca645225ac6476a241767c1e489c2bf88dd1` run. Each trial used the same
262,144 records per signal and 2,000 warm lookup iterations.

| Signal | Baseline durable bytes | Current durable bytes | Reduction | Ratio | Encode MiB/s | Decode MiB/s | Lookup/s | p50 / p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Logs | 9,523,630 | **3,581,357** | **62.40%** | **66.54x** | 105.39 | 827.60 | 81,634.40 | 12.13 / 15.70 us |
| Traces | 1,558,224 | **901,869** | **42.12%** | **119.32x** | 281.59 | 1,265.42 | 700,348.04 | 1.38 / 1.44 us |
| Metrics | 2,242,781 | **1,964,404** | **12.41%** | **64.37x** | 664.47 | 1,853.65 | 173,261.84 | 5.71 / 6.12 us |

Relative to the retained baseline, median encoding improved 11.77% for logs,
4.64% for traces, and 6.70% for metrics. Exact lookup rates stayed within
normal run variance or improved. On the Apple M5 Max development host, the
same 262,144-record run produced 3,581,357, 901,869, and 1,964,404 durable
bytes and measured 325.65, 694.04, and 1,241.14 MiB/s encode throughput for
logs, traces, and metrics respectively. Only the metric path clears 1 GiB/s
per core in that local run; none of the rich signal paths clears that target
on Adam yet.

Section accounting prevented an unproductive sidecar rewrite. Before this
pass, 99.2% of trace payload bytes were IDs, while trace sidecars were only
5,879 bytes. Metric values and timestamps were 85.3% and 11.9% of payload;
sidecars were 42,513 bytes. The retained changes target those dominant lanes:
the metric timestamp lane fell from 263,552 to 2,048 bytes, and trace payload
fell from 1,554,298 to 897,943 bytes. A row-to-column trace-sidecar experiment
was discarded after adding 225 bytes.

Using the retained same-corpus ClickHouse 26.5.1.882 measurements, the current
trace format uses 84.32% fewer bytes and encodes 2.72x faster; the metric format
uses 49.41% fewer bytes and encodes 6.01x faster. ClickHouse was not rerun
because its input and settings are unchanged; this is a comparison with the
retained sequential CPU-0 result, not a newly executed competitor trial.

The immutable 80 GiB Docker JSON corpus was rerun on CPUs `0-15`. Since it has
no typed OTLP metadata, every durable file is byte-identical to the retained
baseline: 620,912,446 total bytes, 138.34x, 10,240 valid block checksums, and
exact first/middle/final reconstruction. The current run completed ingest in
13.624549 seconds at 6,012.68 MiB/s. This timing is a fresh host-scheduled run;
the byte identity, rather than the faster timing, is the no-regression gate.

All 200 library tests, every binary target, formatting, and Clippy with
warnings denied passed. Retained native evidence is at:

The product checkout was clean and detached at the exact revision above. The

Adam's deterministic-simulation framework checkout was dirty, so this remains
revision-pinned native evidence, not deterministic task-schedule replay.

## Current single-format 80 GiB acceptance — 2026-08-04

This is the current pre-release result for commit
`34a8b6fe8bb5120ce71b20a4f40fdb4dc4ecffc8`. It measures the only supported
`STEL` structural format; there are no legacy readers, compatibility formats,
or alternate ShardTelemetry implementations in this comparison.

Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8

CPUs: physical cores `0-15`; SMT siblings `16-31` were excluded

Corpus: 85,899,345,920-byte immutable ClickHouse Docker JSON log

SHA-256: `4fd6379bd89fcb44688a3ebd611729416c82f110fbf49ffef905d9df0ebf0508`

The direct durable-storage path normalized and accepted 85,899,343,853 bytes
across 607,363,459 records. Seven malformed complete records totaling 1,973
bytes were rejected and reported. The run used 8 MiB blocks, 16 workers,
Zstandard level 1, the production-default disabled locality router, and no
second persistent term/field sidecar.

| Metric | Current ShardTelemetry |
| --- | ---: |
| Structural bytes before Zstd | 15,026,825,037 |
| Embedded compression-derived index before Zstd | 384,399,867 |
| Zstd payload bytes | 620,093,229 |
| Manifest bytes | 819,217 |
| Durable total | **620,912,446** |
| Raw-source compression ratio | **138.34x** |
| Ingest wall time | **13.625 s** |
| End-to-end throughput | **6,012.68 MiB/s** |

All 10,240 payload checksums passed. The verifier also reconstructed the first,
middle, and final blocks exactly. Compared with the accepted historical Pco-8
result, the current format stores 7,561,221 fewer bytes and is 1.20% smaller.
Compared with the first telemetry expansion run, it stores 40,419,454 fewer
bytes and is 6.11% smaller. This closes the homogeneous-corpus no-regression
gate while retaining the embedded lookup index.

The storage improvement comes from making the frame index complementary to the
codec: adaptive run-length/bit-packed ordinal columns, authoritative template
IDs reused by body decoding, collision-safe 24-bit term/field fingerprints,
and one shared fail-open membership hint. Fingerprint and filter collisions can
only add candidates; exact selective decode remains the result authority.

### Same-host retained engine comparison

The rows below use the same Adam host, physical CPU set, and immutable corpus.
They were run sequentially and retained independently. ShardTelemetry and
ClickHouse use their native storage harnesses; Loki includes its HTTP JSON
compatibility boundary, so the table is an engine-level result rather than a
same-protocol claim.

| Engine | Settled durable bytes | Ratio | Wall time | Throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ShardTelemetry `34a8b6f` | **620,912,446** | **138.34x** | **13.625 s** | **6,012.68 MiB/s** |
| ClickHouse 26.5.1.882 | 1,175,650,470 | 73.07x | 89.46 s | 915.72 MiB/s |
| Loki 3.7.2 | 4,905,868,184 | 17.51x | 1,010.043 s | 81.11 MiB/s |

On this corpus ShardTelemetry is 6.57x faster than ClickHouse and uses 47.2%
fewer durable bytes. It is 74.1x faster than the Loki compatibility run and
uses 7.90x less settled storage. These results do not establish the separate
1 GiB/s-per-core or 80%-scaling-through-16-cores gates: the measured aggregate
rate is 5.87 GiB/s, or about 376 MiB/s per assigned core if divided naively.

## Native fully indexed ingest optimization series — 1 GiB

Date: 2026-07-30  
Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
Corpus: first complete-record span covering 1,073,741,933 source bytes and
7,592,023 records from the immutable 80 GiB ClickHouse Docker JSON corpus  
Protocol: native grouped batches, 1 MiB target, 16 ShardTelemetry owner stripes,
leader-durable shard-stream append, and indexed acknowledgement  
Storage: one authoritative shard-stream copy; the optional recovery journal
was disabled

The profile-guided series kept the corpus, durability, record count, and
server shard count fixed:

| Stage | Source throughput | Peak server RSS | Main change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| v2 baseline | 65.95 MiB/s | not retained | Original native durable/indexed path |
| v3 | 85.84 MiB/s | not retained | Foldhash, allocation-free term scanner, consolidated record state |
| v4 | 112.42 MiB/s | 12,294,732 KiB | Removed duplicate raw recovery journal |
| v5 | 121.06 MiB/s | not retained | Bounded exact-message term cache |
| v7 | 167.49 MiB/s | 5,991,060 KiB | Partition-local record ordinals and `u32` postings |
| v9 | 289.76 MiB/s | 3,293,284 KiB | Shared immutable metadata, repeated-body reuse, non-materializing pre-validation, append fast path |
| v11 | 380.29 MiB/s | 3,312,004 KiB | 32 connections instead of 16 |
| v14 best | **423.37 MiB/s** | 3,321,092 KiB | Partition-local dense posting slots and exact field cache |

The v9 change improved the identical 16-connection run from 169.44 to
289.76 MiB/s, reduced sampled server cycles from approximately 58.9 billion to
23.0 billion, and reduced peak RSS by 45.0%. The complete series improved the
best observed end-to-end result by 6.42x.

The 32-connection result is not yet a stable production rate. Three repetitions
of the current binary at 1 MiB produced 219.24, 240.78, and 425.27 MiB/s
(median 240.78 MiB/s). Server CPU work and stored bytes were nearly constant;
wall time changed according to whether adjacent shard-stream appends joined
the same fsync group. Raising append linger to 1 ms retained the same
approximately 219/424 MiB/s bimodality. A 2 MiB batch regressed to a
210.29 MiB/s median and increased kernel time.

Adam exposes 32 logical CPUs as 16 SMT sibling pairs: `0/16`, `1/17`, through
`15/31`. The early `0-15` server and `16-31` producer split therefore shared
physical cores. Repeating with both processes constrained to `0-15` retained
the same 216-423 MiB/s range, which rules out the affinity split as the primary
cause but means none of these rows is a server-only 16-core measurement.

Every 1 GiB run wrote 832,404,552 native payload bytes and occupied about
795 MiB on disk. That raw authoritative WAL write is now the throughput
ceiling: ShardTelemetry's structural block compressor runs above 2 GiB/s on this
corpus, but compression currently occurs after the raw shard-stream append.
Reaching sustainable multi-GiB/s durable ingestion requires an explicitly
approved recovery-format change that makes a checksummed structural-compressed
ingest pack authoritative before fsync. Asynchronous acknowledgement alone
would only hide index/WAL lag and is not counted as a throughput result.

## Loki-wire durability ablation — 128 MiB

Date: 2026-07-30  
Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
CPUs: physical cores `0-15` for each sequential engine run  
Source: first 128 MiB of the immutable 80 GiB ClickHouse Docker JSON corpus  
Client: `shard-telemetry-loki-load`, 16 deterministic file spans, 16 persistent HTTP
connections, and 1 MiB Loki JSON push batches  
Records accepted by both engines: 949,018

| Engine | Source throughput | Total disk bytes after run |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| ShardTelemetry durable API | 43.16 MiB/s | 241,490,286 |
| Grafana Loki 3.7.2 | 57.63 MiB/s | 120,076,424 |

Loki used image
`sha256:191d4fdfb7264f16989f0a57f320872620a5a7c2ceeec6229212c4190ec49b86`
with its ingestion rate and burst limits raised so the database, rather than a
4 MiB/s tenant throttle, determined throughput.

This is a failed ShardTelemetry ablation, not an accepted full result. The direct
structural benchmark did not include the production durability path. Here
ShardTelemetry retained the authoritative shard-stream source packs and a second raw
sink recovery journal, while sealed compressed block payloads remained
memory-owned. The full 80 GiB ShardTelemetry result is therefore gated on durable
compressed-block publication, cold reads, and reclaiming raw source ranges
covered by published blocks. See `LOKI_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

## Loki 3.7.2 — full 80 GiB Loki-wire ingest

Date: 2026-07-30  
Host and CPUs: Adam, physical cores `0-15`  
Corpus: the same immutable 80 GiB file and SHA-256 used by the ShardTelemetry and
ClickHouse runs below  
Image:
`sha256:191d4fdfb7264f16989f0a57f320872620a5a7c2ceeec6229212c4190ec49b86`

The same `shard-telemetry-loki-load` client used for the bounded ablation sent 1 MiB
Loki JSON pushes over 16 persistent connections. Every submitted batch
received HTTP 200/204. The client reached the known truncated final physical
line after sending all complete records and exited nonzero while parsing that
tail; the fixed client now skips a non-newline-terminated final fragment just
as the established ShardTelemetry/ClickHouse harness skips the leading fragment.

| Source bytes represented | Settled disk bytes | Ratio | Wall time | Throughput |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 85,899,345,826 | 3,782,890,631 | 22.71x | 976.70 s | 83.87 MiB/s |

Settled components after `/flush` and WAL checkpoint:

| Component | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| Chunks | 3,782,791,668 |
| WAL | 0 |
| Active TSDB shipper | 69,748 |
| TSDB shipper cache | 29,215 |
| Total | 3,782,890,631 |

The WAL-inclusive footprint was observed between roughly 30 and 40 GiB during
ingest before checkpoint reclamation. Both peak and settled storage matter for
capacity planning; the compression ratio uses settled durable storage.

### Provisional same-corpus comparison

The rows below use the same immutable source and the same Adam physical CPU set,
but are not yet a single-interface campaign: ShardTelemetry and ClickHouse are the
previous sequential indexed native-engine run, while Loki includes Loki HTTP
JSON framing and the shared wire client.

| Engine | Settled stored bytes | Raw-source ratio | Throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ShardTelemetry + exact index | **743,581,572** | **115.52x** | **1,214.17 MiB/s** |
| Loki 3.7.2 | 3,782,890,631 | 22.71x | 83.87 MiB/s |
| ClickHouse + text index | 6,093,155,990 | 14.10x | 353.33 MiB/s |

This table does not satisfy the final drop-in service acceptance gate.
ShardTelemetry's Loki-wire durable path currently fails the bounded comparison and
must publish cold blocks and reclaim source data before a three-service
sequential rerun is meaningful.

## LogHub HDFS — 1 GiB run

Run date: 2026-07-29  
Corpus: [LogHub HDFS_1](https://zenodo.org/records/3227177), a public HDFS
machine-log dataset. Archive checksum: `b0d0a8bed97530bccf0babdf3a905572`.

Command:

```text
cargo run --release --bin shard-telemetry-compress-bench -- /path/to/HDFS.log --limit-bytes 1GiB
```

The line-oriented input boundary made the measured source `1,073,741,791`
bytes: the largest complete-line prefix not exceeding 1 GiB. Blocks target 8
MiB; zstd level is 3; the trained dictionary is 112 KiB and is included in the
dictionary result.

| Layout | Stored bytes | Ratio | Source retained |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Independent zstd blocks | 105,156,269 | 10.21x | 9.79% |
| zstd + trained dictionary | 105,248,502 | 10.20x | 9.80% |
| Prototype template column | 100,640,713 | 10.67x | 9.37% |
| Template column + static-term block index | 100,641,996 | 10.67x | 9.37% |

The template run found 52 templates, 124 static terms, and 70 encoded blocks.
Its final total includes compressed records (100,639,419 bytes), the template
table (1,294 bytes), and the static-term index (1,283 bytes).

This is deliberately an honest lower bound for the prototype’s indexed layout:
it excludes per-record postings for high-cardinality variable values and does
not include OTLP envelope or metadata-column storage. The result therefore
does not support assuming 100x compression for transparent raw-log retention.
Reaching that territory would require a semantic representation with a
different value-storage/index policy, validated separately for fidelity and
query cost.

## Adam Docker json-file — 1 GiB run

Run date: 2026-07-29  
Corpus: a live ClickHouse container's Docker `json-file` log on Adam. The
benchmark executed on Adam against the protected file itself: a static
benchmark binary and that one log file were mounted into an ephemeral,
network-disabled, read-only helper container. The helper had a RAM-backed
directory writable only for its text report; no log data was copied off host.

The measured input is `1,073,741,765` bytes, the largest complete-line prefix
not exceeding 1 GiB. It preserves Docker's JSON wrapper, including timestamps,
stream metadata, and escaped message body.

| Layout | Stored bytes | Ratio | Source retained |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Independent zstd blocks | 46,961,071 | 22.86x | 4.37% |
| zstd + trained dictionary | 47,183,439 | 22.76x | 4.39% |
| Prototype template column | 46,840,158 | 22.92x | 4.36% |
| Template column + static-term block index | 46,840,543 | **22.92x** | **4.36%** |

This run found 22 templates, 45 static terms, and 84 encoded template blocks.
The final total comprises compressed records (46,839,651 bytes), the template
table (507 bytes), and the static-term index (385 bytes). Like the HDFS run,
it excludes high-cardinality per-record postings and any OTLP-normalized
columns, so it is a storage-layout baseline rather than a full serving-size
claim.

## Adam Docker json-file — implemented structural layout, 1 GiB run

Run date: 2026-07-29  
Corpus: the same immutable ClickHouse Docker `json-file` tail on Adam. The
tail begins mid-record, so the benchmark discards that one incomplete leading
line and measures `1,073,741,671` bytes of complete Docker JSON records. It
normalizes each record into exact body text, a nanosecond event timestamp, and
one `docker.stream` metadata field. The first structural block is decoded and
compared field-for-field before measurement continues.

Command:

```text
shard-telemetry-structural-bench /path/to/docker-json.log --limit-bytes 1GiB
```

| Layout | Stored bytes | Ratio against raw Docker source | Source retained |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Raw Docker JSON, zstd-1 | 42,048,146 | 25.54x | 3.92% |
| Structural payload before zstd | 214,310,852 | 5.01x | 19.96% |
| Structural payload, zstd-1 | **10,463,133** | **102.62x** | **0.97%** |

The structural payload is 75.12% smaller than raw Docker JSON compressed with
the same zstd-1 level (a 31,585,013-byte reduction per GiB). Raw zstd encoded
at 1,489 MiB/s; zstd over the already-normalized structural payload encoded at
1,513 MiB/s. This ratio includes a semantic representation gain—the Docker
JSON wrapper is replaced with typed fields—while retaining the body, timestamp,
and stream. It must therefore not be read as a byte-for-byte archival JSON
claim or as a prediction for heterogeneous OTLP traffic.

## Codec matrix — immutable Adam ClickHouse JSON corpus

Run date: 2026-07-29  
Corpus: `clickhouse-docker-json-error-loop-tail-80g-20260729.log` on Adam.
The raw file is exactly 80 GiB and has SHA-256
`4fd6379bd89fcb44688a3ebd611729416c82f110fbf49ffef905d9df0ebf0508`.

Every codec used independent 8 MiB blocks and passed a first-block
compress/decompress round-trip. Reported MiB/s is time spent compressing
already-read blocks, not filesystem read throughput. This corpus is a
high-repetition ClickHouse error-loop tail, so its ratios are not a proxy for
all production logs.

### Complete 1 GiB codec comparison

Command:

```text
cargo run --release --bin shard-telemetry-codec-bench -- /path/to/raw.log --codecs all
```

The complete matrix uses a fresh reader and independent 8 MiB blocks for every
codec. The benchmark verifies a first-block round trip for every row and times
compression after the input block has been read. It does not use a trained
dictionary, so it is a baseline for choosing a byte codec rather than a claim
about the final normalized shard-telemetry layout.

| Codec | Stored bytes | Ratio | Retained | Compression throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Copy | 1,073,741,824 | 1.00x | 100.00% | 11,691 MiB/s |
| `lz4_flex` | 81,142,348 | 13.23x | 7.56% | 1,897 MiB/s |
| `lz4_native` | 81,110,632 | 13.24x | 7.55% | 2,261 MiB/s |
| `lz4_native_hc-9` | 62,630,026 | 17.14x | 5.83% | 133 MiB/s |
| `snap` | 119,801,022 | 8.96x | 11.16% | **2,410 MiB/s** |
| `s2` | 93,329,078 | 11.50x | 8.69% | 2,118 MiB/s |
| `s2_better` | 91,011,664 | 11.80x | 8.48% | 551 MiB/s |
| `s2_best` | 84,874,530 | 12.65x | 7.90% | 142 MiB/s |
| `minlz_balanced` | 72,829,036 | 14.74x | 6.78% | 479 MiB/s |
| DEFLATE level 6 | 42,822,645 | 25.07x | 3.99% | 128 MiB/s |
| `libdeflate-6` | 40,665,196 | 26.40x | 3.79% | 333 MiB/s |
| `zlib_rs-6` | 42,149,520 | 25.47x | 3.93% | 270 MiB/s |
| `zopfli-5` | 36,168,767 | 29.69x | 3.37% | 0.50 MiB/s |
| `brotli-5` | 42,479,572 | 25.28x | 3.96% | 62 MiB/s |
| `bzip2-9` | **32,413,164** | **33.13x** | **3.02%** | 11.7 MiB/s |
| `xz2-6` | 40,033,340 | 26.82x | 3.73% | 18.5 MiB/s |
| `lzma_rust2_xz-6` | 40,018,544 | 26.83x | 3.73% | 9.6 MiB/s |
| `lzfse` | 50,841,869 | 21.12x | 4.74% | 161 MiB/s |
| `lzfse_rust` | 50,834,312 | 21.12x | 4.73% | 212 MiB/s |
| `zrip-1` | 48,505,369 | 22.14x | 4.52% | 1,053 MiB/s |
| `zrip-4` | 50,450,929 | 21.28x | 4.70% | 804 MiB/s |
| `zstd-1` | 42,045,476 | 25.54x | 3.92% | 1,374 MiB/s |
| `zstd-3` | 46,959,090 | 22.87x | 4.37% | 1,146 MiB/s |
| `zstd-9` | 38,958,957 | 27.56x | 3.63% | 151 MiB/s |

The practical Pareto choices in the Apache-2.0 distribution are Snappy, native
LZ4, zstd-1, libdeflate-6, zstd-9, and bzip2-9. GPL- and AGPL-licensed codecs
used in an early research sweep, along with codecs lacking declared license
metadata, are not linked into or selectable from the released benchmark
binary. Zopfli is dominated by bzip2-9 on this corpus:
bzip2 is both smaller and more than twenty times faster.

### Selection guide

| Priority | Recommended policy | Why | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lowest encode latency | Native LZ4 | 13.24x at about 2.26 GiB/s; substantially smaller than Snappy for only a small throughput cost. | Stores about twice as many bytes as zstd-1. |
| Default hot storage | zstd level 1 | 25.54x at 1.37 GiB/s; it dominates most middle-ground codecs. | Less peak throughput than LZ4. |
| Background compact storage | libdeflate-6 | 26.40x at 333 MiB/s; modestly smaller than zstd-1. | Requires a separate codec path and is about four times slower than zstd-1. |
| Cold searchable storage | zstd level 9 | 27.56x at 151 MiB/s; a good compact, queryable block format. | About nine times slower than zstd-1. |
| Offline deep archive | bzip2 level 9 | Best measured ratio, 33.13x. | Only 11.7 MiB/s; do not use on the ingest or query path. |

The initial implementation remains zstd level 1. A future compactor may
rewrite sealed, immutable blocks to zstd level 9. Do not put Zopfli, bzip2,
or XZ on the online query path; their one-shot ratios do not compensate for
their encode cost or their poor operational fit for independently retrievable
blocks.

### 80 GiB Pareto validation

| Codec | Stored bytes | Ratio | Retained | Compression time | Throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `lz4_flex` | 6,485,916,300 | 13.24x | 7.55% | 43.25 s | 1,894 MiB/s |
| `snap` | 9,576,902,250 | 8.97x | 11.15% | 33.18 s | 2,469 MiB/s |
| zstd level 1 | 3,344,308,661 | 25.69x | 3.89% | 53.98 s | 1,518 MiB/s |
| zstd level 9 | **3,088,103,261** | **27.82x** | **3.60%** | 558.76 s | 147 MiB/s |

For this corpus, zstd-1 is the clear hot-tier default: it is 25.69x while
compressing at 1.52 GiB/s. zstd-9 saves a further 256,205,400 bytes (7.66%)
over zstd-1 but takes 10.35x as long, making it a cold-tier option. Snappy is
the pure speed winner; LZ4 is 32.3% smaller at 76.7% of Snappy's throughput.

## ShardTelemetry versus ClickHouse — sequential 80 GiB ingest

Run date: 2026-07-29  
Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
Corpus:
`/home/dtietjen/log-compression-samples/clickhouse-docker-json-error-loop-tail-80g-20260729.log`

The source is exactly 80 GiB with SHA-256
`4fd6379bd89fcb44688a3ebd611729416c82f110fbf49ffef905d9df0ebf0508`.
It contains one 94-byte leading partial line and seven malformed complete
records totaling 1,973 bytes. Both engines rejected those same records and
accepted exactly 607,363,459 typed log records spanning 85,899,343,853 source
bytes.

The engines ran sequentially. Each received CPUs `0-15`, the first hardware
thread of Adam's 16 physical cores; SMT siblings `16-31` were not used. The
entire source was read immediately before each timed leg to give both the same
hot-cache treatment.

ShardTelemetry used deterministic 8 MiB complete-line ranges, 16 owner-local parser,
structural-encoder, and zstd-1 contexts, 16 durable pack files, and one ordered
manifest. Pack files and the manifest were synchronized before the ingest
timer stopped. Every payload checksum was then verified and the first, middle,
and last blocks were decompressed and decoded outside the timed interval.

ClickHouse 26.5.1.882 ran in an isolated container pinned to the same CPU set.
Its typed `MergeTree` stored `time DateTime64(9)` with
`DoubleDelta, ZSTD(1)`, `stream LowCardinality(String)` with `ZSTD(1)`, and
`log String` with `ZSTD(1)`, ordered by `(stream, time)`. The table enabled
`fsync_after_insert`. A pinned in-container adapter skipped only the leading
partial line and streamed the remaining immutable file into `JSONEachRow`;
the server's error allowance was set to ShardTelemetry's measured count of seven.
The final row-count equality was a mandatory harness gate.

| Engine | Accepted records | Durable stored bytes | Compression ratio | Ingest time | Throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ShardTelemetry | 607,363,459 | **826,364,011** | **103.95x** | **64.890 s** | **1,262.44 MiB/s** |
| ClickHouse | 607,363,459 | 1,175,227,112 | 73.09x | 86.850 s | 943.24 MiB/s |

ShardTelemetry was 1.338x as fast and used 348,863,101 fewer durable bytes, a 29.68%
reduction from ClickHouse's active-part size. Its ratio was 1.422x higher.
The ShardTelemetry total includes 825,544,794 bytes of pack payload and an 819,217
byte manifest. The ClickHouse total is `sum(bytes_on_disk)` for the 20 active
table parts, including their active data, marks, and part metadata. It does not
use the whole container data-directory size, which also contained system data
and transient inactive parts immediately after ingestion.

This result demonstrates greater than 100x compression for this particular,
highly repetitive error-loop corpus after replacing Docker JSON syntax with a
typed semantic representation. It is not a byte-identical JSON archival ratio
and is not a general prediction for heterogeneous OTLP logs.

## ShardTelemetry versus indexed ClickHouse — 80 GiB ingest and query

Run date: 2026-07-30  
Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
Execution tier: native Linux host-performance evidence; this is not a
logical-time or exact-replay simulation.

This comparison adds serving indexes to both engines. ShardTelemetry used its
persistent exact term/field index and selective structural decoder. ClickHouse
26.5.1 used its generally available `text` index with
`splitByNonAlpha` tokenization and a lowercase preprocessor.

The source was the same immutable 80 GiB file with SHA-256
`4fd6379bd89fcb44688a3ebd611729416c82f110fbf49ffef905d9df0ebf0508`.
The complete-line range contained seven malformed rows totaling 1,973 bytes.
Both engines received all 85,899,345,826 complete-line bytes, retained exactly
seven parse errors, and accepted exactly 607,363,459 records. The harness
compared canonical timestamp, stream, and body output byte-for-byte before
timing every query class.

Both legs ran sequentially on physical CPUs `0-15`, with the exact source
range prewarmed immediately before each ingest. ShardTelemetry used 16 owner-local
workers, 8 MiB blocks, Pco timestamps, zstd level 1, disabled locality and
real-time dictionary experiments, synchronized packs and manifest, and its
persistent query index. ClickHouse used a `MergeTree` ordered by
`(stream, time)`, `DateTime64(9)` with `DoubleDelta, ZSTD(1)`,
`LowCardinality(String)` stream storage, `ZSTD(1)` bodies, the text index, and
`fsync_after_insert = 1`.

### Ingest and storage

| Engine | Stored bytes | Raw-source ratio | External wall time | External throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ShardTelemetry + exact index | **743,581,572** | **115.52x** | **67.47 s** | **1,214.17 MiB/s** |
| ClickHouse + text index | 6,093,155,990 | 14.10x | 231.85 s | 353.33 MiB/s |

The conservative process-level result makes ShardTelemetry 3.44x faster and 8.19x
smaller, an 87.80% stored-byte reduction. ShardTelemetry's external time includes
25.19 seconds of post-ingest checksum and sampled reconstruction verification.
Its durable stage alone took 35.43 seconds at 2,311.95 MiB/s, but that number
is not used in the headline because the comparison records the stricter
whole-process wall time.

| Component | ShardTelemetry | ClickHouse |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Compressed structural/data bytes | 628,909,207 | 1,172,219,181 |
| Search index bytes | 113,853,148 | 4,918,354,227 |
| Manifest/marks/remaining active-part bytes | 819,217 | 2,582,582 |
| Total | **743,581,572** | 6,093,155,990 |

The compressed ShardTelemetry index is 43.2x smaller than ClickHouse's text index.
The normalized data lane itself is 1.86x smaller than ClickHouse's compressed
typed columns. These ratios are against the raw Docker source and therefore
include replacing the JSON wrapper with typed fields; they are not
byte-identical JSON archival ratios.

### Warm query latency

Every row reports 200 sequential warm queries returning at most 100 records.
ShardTelemetry latency includes planning, pack read, payload checksum, zstd
decompression, and selective record decode. ClickHouse latency is measured by
`clickhouse-benchmark` over its local native client/server path. The forced
scan disables skip indexes and is a reference, not the indexed head-to-head.

| Query | ShardTelemetry p50 / p99 | ClickHouse indexed p50 / p99 | ClickHouse scan p50 | ShardTelemetry p50 advantage |

| Five-term AND | 1.154 / 1.201 ms | 570 / 599 ms | 586 ms | 494x |
| Missing term | 0.00015 / 0.00019 ms | 11 / 12 ms | 1,571 ms | about 73,000x |

The corpus is a homogeneous error loop and nearly every row is `stderr`.
Positive terms such as `cannot` occur almost everywhere, so ClickHouse's text
index cannot prune those workloads. Conversely, `(stream, time)` ordering
makes the stream-filtered ClickHouse query efficient, and its indexed missing
term avoids the 1.57-second full scan. This matrix intentionally includes both
favorable and unfavorable selectivity cases.

### Current ShardTelemetry cost

Query execution is fast, but the benchmark's monolithic index representation
is not production-ready at this scale:

- the 113,853,148-byte on-disk index expands to 17,071,691,984 bytes
  (15.90 GiB) of resident posting storage;
- loading it takes about 23.0 seconds; and
- indexed ingest peaks at 102,406,520 KiB (97.66 GiB) RSS.

The next optimization is therefore segmented, mmap-friendly postings that
retain run/delta encoding and load only selected block directories. These
figures also explain why the result is an engine-level comparison, not yet a
production service claim. ShardTelemetry ran in-process without an RPC layer;
ClickHouse ran as a warm server over its local native protocol.

This native campaign is command-replayable on the same corpus and host class,
but timing is not exact-replay deterministic. The isolated comparison
container was stopped and removed by the harness; its data, query outputs,

The route-cache hit rate was effectively 100% after power-of-two warmup. Each
stripe preallocated 387,840 bytes in five buffers; the cache-hit path performed
no heap allocation. The representative run placed 979,520 records in fine
buckets and used base placement for the first 20,480 observations.

These are single-core component measurements. The acceptance decision uses the
full 16-core durable corpus run below, because parsing, structural encoding,
compression, and pack synchronization determine end-to-end throughput.

## Historical real-service deterministic interleaving

Run date: 2026-07-29  
Host: Adam, one Ryzen 9 3950X physical core  
Evidence:
`/home/dtietjen/shard-telemetry-locality-interleaving-20260729-v1`

The harness collected bounded tails from three independent live services:
Pluribus, Eden's telemetry hot path, and the OpenTelemetry Collector. A
lossless adapter put each original message line into a Docker JSON envelope
with a fixed valid timestamp, then `shard-telemetry-interleave` emitted one complete
line from each source in round-robin order. The resulting 76,851-record corpus
was 26,408,726 bytes. Both modes used one worker and 1 MiB target blocks.

| Mode | Stored bytes | Ratio | Elapsed | Throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Routing disabled | 1,443,611 | 18.29x | 0.2492 s | 101.06 MiB/s |
| Routing enabled | **1,385,107** | **19.07x** | 0.3302 s | 76.27 MiB/s |

The superseded record router saved 58,504 bytes, or 4.05% of the disabled stored size. It
admitted seven specialized placements and routed 60,398 records fine, 6,747
coarse, and 9,706 base, for a 12.63% fallback rate. The route-cache hit rate
was 98.74%.

The single-core enabled leg was 24.53% slower. This sample demonstrates a real
placement benefit but is too small to be a universal ratio claim; the separate
80 GiB run establishes multicore throughput and homogeneous no-regression.

## Historical locality acceptance — sequential 80 GiB ingest

Run date: 2026-07-29  
Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
Evidence:
`/home/dtietjen/shard-telemetry-head-to-head/full-80g-locality-20260729-v1`

The finalized harness ran three sequential legs with identical source
prewarming and CPUs `0-15`: ShardTelemetry with routing disabled, ShardTelemetry with
routing enabled, and ClickHouse. All accepted exactly 607,363,459 records and
85,899,343,853 source bytes. Every ShardTelemetry payload checksum passed, and the
first, middle, and last blocks decompressed and decoded successfully after
ingest.

| Engine | Stored bytes | Ratio | Elapsed | Throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ShardTelemetry, routing disabled | **826,364,011** | **103.95x** | **70.2466 s** | **1,166.18 MiB/s** |
| ShardTelemetry, routing enabled | **826,364,011** | **103.95x** | 76.5802 s | 1,069.73 MiB/s |
| ClickHouse | 1,176,062,051 | 73.04x | 87.3700 s | 937.62 MiB/s |

The enabled router cleared the required 1 GiB/s floor and did not change
stored size by one byte. It was 8.27% slower than the disabled ablation, but
still 14.09% faster than ClickHouse. It stored 349,698,040 fewer bytes than
ClickHouse, a 29.74% reduction from ClickHouse's active-part size.

Storage accounting for both ShardTelemetry legs:

| Component | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| Accepted Docker JSON source | 85,899,343,853 |
| Structural payload before zstd | 17,144,825,250 |
| zstd-1 pack payload | 825,544,794 |
| Manifest | 819,217 |
| Persistent term/field index | 0 in the direct corpus encoder |
| Compression dictionaries | 0 |
| Durable pack plus manifest | 826,364,011 |

Routing diagnostics for the enabled leg:

| Diagnostic | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Route-cache hit rate | 99.9993% |
| Fine / coarse / base records | 0 / 0 / 607,363,459 |
| Fallback rate | 100% |
| Active specialized placements | 0 |
| Router state across 16 workers | 6,205,440 bytes |
| Process user CPU time | 1,100.90 s |
| Process system CPU time | 29.96 s |
| Maximum RSS | 599,888 KiB |

The corpus is one homogeneous ClickHouse error loop, but its individual
template buckets did not independently reach durable admission under the
bounded aging policy. All records therefore failed open to the source cohort.
This is the intended no-regression behavior, not a measured locality gain.

These numbers do not select the current pre-release default. The block
collator replaced this router and must independently tie or improve stored
size while sustaining at least 1 GiB/s on Adam.

## Block-collation implementation validation

Implementation date: 2026-07-29

The current code replaces per-record bucket routing with block-level
temperature scoring and bounded redistribution:

- 16-bit SimHash temperatures, XOR Hamming distance, and a fixed mismatch
  penalty for Eden-style exact template-shape hashes;
- byte-weighted block centroids, Q8 mean squared internal variance, and maximum
  deviation;
- farthest-point seeds, nearest-seed assignment, and at most two recursive
  split levels;
- at most 16 stripe-local compression-shard profiles;
- destination buffers that retain matching records and refill space left by
  moved deviations;
- implicit contiguous membership for unsplit blocks and packed `u32`
  memberships split into owned prefixes and tails through `bytes-handoff`;
- bounded split-exploration backoff after repeated fallback-only blocks; and
- fail-open base placement for sparse, highly variant, or over-capacity leaves.

Local unit and property-style tests pass for deterministic splitting,
membership conservation, bounded profiles and split depth, sparse/capacity
fallback, mixed-block filtering/refill, exact UTF-8 reconstruction, offset
preservation, and unchanged term/field queries. `cargo test --all-targets` and
`cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` are the implementation gates.

An early reduced release-mode smoke run on the Darwin arm64 development host
used 200,000 iterations and 20,000 stripe records:

| Operation | Development smoke result |
| --- | ---: |
| Tentative existing-shard lookup | 218.53 Mrecords/s |
| Tentative bounded-shard probe | 210.10 Mrecords/s |
| Block score/split/assignment | 7,988.70 MiB/s, 32.72 Mrecords/s |
| Persistent profile state | 3,072 bytes |
| Fingerprint + tentative placement | 378.36 MiB/s, 7.21 Mrecords/s |
| Stripe ingest, 64 KiB blocks | 0.91 Mrecords/s |
| Seal latency | 206.88 µs p50, 380.96 µs p99 |

This is a local implementation smoke test, not an acceptance result. In
particular, block score throughput operates on already fingerprinted compact
records and must not be interpreted as end-to-end log ingest throughput.

### Historical 80 GiB implementation ablation

Run date: 2026-07-29 local / 2026-07-30 UTC  
Host: Adam, Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
CPU set: physical cores `0-15`, sequential execution  
Block size: 8 MiB  
Source SHA-256:
`4fd6379bd89fcb44688a3ebd611729416c82f110fbf49ffef905d9df0ebf0508`

The matrix used one immutable source and mandatory equality gates for
85,899,343,853 accepted source bytes and 607,363,459 records:

| Historical implementation and mode | Stored bytes | Ratio | Seconds | MiB/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Historical TinyLFU, disabled | 826,364,011 | 103.95x | 70.060 | 1,169.28 |
| Historical TinyLFU, enabled | 826,364,011 | 103.95x | 76.604 | 1,069.40 |
| Block collator v5, disabled | 826,364,011 | 103.95x | 75.981 | 1,078.16 |
| Block collator v5, enabled | 826,364,011 | 103.95x | 80.042 | 1,023.46 |
| ClickHouse 26.5.1.882 | 1,175,260,664 | 73.09x | 87.830 | 932.71 |

The historical router cost 8.54% against its disabled control. Block
collation v5 cost 5.07% against its disabled control. This homogeneous corpus
admitted no specialized placement, so all ShardTelemetry rows are byte-identical.

The matrix exposed an enabled-only offset-ordering defect during its first
attempt. The incomplete run is retained separately. The fix merges relocated
sub-blocks by logical offset and has a dedicated regression test.

### Final v6 acceptance

After the complete matrix, v6 replaced packed root membership with an implicit
contiguous range. Actual split leaves still use `bytes-handoff`. A separately
prewarmed, CPU-identical full pass produced:

| Version | Stored bytes | Ratio | Seconds | MiB/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Block collator v6, enabled | **826,364,011** | **103.95x** | **79.177** | **1,034.64** |

This clears the 1 GiB/s gate by 10.64 MiB/s. It scored 11,296 blocks and
sub-blocks, performed 528 splits, suppressed 10,064 repeated unproductive
explorations, and transferred 83,512,504 packed membership bytes through
`bytes-handoff`. Every record remained in base placement, every one of 10,240
payload checksums passed, and sampled blocks decompressed and reconstructed
exactly.

Compared with ClickHouse from the sequential matrix, v6 was 1.109x as fast
and stored 348,896,653 fewer bytes, a 29.69% reduction. Compared with v5,
implicit root membership reduced handoff volume by 96.68% and improved
throughput by 1.09%.

The remaining acceptance work is the deterministic heterogeneous
Pluribus/Eden/OTEL interleaving matrix; this corpus validates throughput and
homogeneous no-regression, not placement gain.

## Current pre-release default — Pco timestamps, zstd payload

Run date: 2026-07-29 local / 2026-07-30 UTC  
Host: Adam, Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
CPU set: physical cores `0-15`, sequential execution  
Block size: 8 MiB  
Pco: 1.0.2, compression level 8  
Outer codec: zstd 1.5.7, level 1

The source remained the immutable 80 GiB corpus with SHA-256
`4fd6379bd89fcb44688a3ebd611729416c82f110fbf49ffef905d9df0ebf0508`.
Both final legs accepted 607,363,459 records and 85,899,343,853 source
bytes, rejected the same seven malformed records totaling 1,973 bytes, wrote
and synchronized 16 pack files plus the ordered manifest, verified all 10,240
payload checksums, and exactly reconstructed sampled first, middle, and last
blocks.

### Timestamp representation ablation

The zstd library investigation showed that timestamps contributed 4,510,097
bytes—86.2% of the complete stored frames—on a 512 MiB, 3,796,013-record
slice. Bodies compressed to 241,005 bytes at 309.3x, so further text placement
could not address the dominant bytes.

| Timestamp representation | Raw bytes | zstd-1 / codec bytes | Change from prior timestamp lane |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prior direction-tagged delta + zstd-1 | 11,388,962 | 4,510,097 | baseline |
| Monotonic delta varint + zstd-1 | 7,593,077 | 4,129,361 | -8.44% |
| Byte-shuffled delta + zstd-1 | 9,490,783 | 4,120,277 | -8.64% |
| Two byte-shuffled `i32` words + zstd-1 | 30,368,104 | 7,561,921 | +67.67% |
| Epoch hour/minute/second/millisecond/nanosecond + zstd-1 | 45,552,156 | 7,181,696 | +59.24% |
| Pco level 8 | 3,330,012 | 3,330,012 | **-26.16%** |

The measured timestamp deltas had a 6.32-bit Shannon lower bound on this
slice. Pco-8 used 7.02 bits/value, encoded 36.04 million values/s per core,
decoded 306.55 million values/s, and passed exact round trips for every frame.
Pco-12 reached 6.73 bits/value but encoded only 9.69 million values/s, so level
8 is the selected Pareto point.

The native 256-record checkpoint prototype used a sampled median predictor,
scaled byte-shuffled `i8`/`i16`/`i32` residual lanes, and full-timestamp
exceptions. It reduced the integrated 1 GiB durable total by only 2.37% and
was 1.46% slower in the repeated A/B. Replacing the median with the first
delta retained the raw reduction but made complete-frame storage 6.96% worse
than the median variant. Neither native prototype remains in the single
pre-release format.

### Integrated 1 GiB gate

| Variant | Durable bytes | Ratio | Seconds | MiB/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Prior timestamp format | 10,472,712 | 102.53x | 1.0657 | 960.87 |
| Native checkpoint/predictor | 10,224,947 | 105.01x | 1.0739 | 953.58 |
| Pco-8 timestamp column | **7,946,802** | **135.12x** | **1.0590** | **966.99** |

Pco reduced the 1 GiB durable total by 24.12% without a throughput penalty.
Every leg used the same prewarm, CPUs, worker count, block spans, durable
writes, and post-ingest verification.

### Full 80 GiB acceptance

| Engine / mode | Durable bytes | Ratio | Seconds | MiB/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Previous ShardTelemetry v6, locality enabled | 826,364,011 | 103.95x | 79.177 | 1,034.64 |
| Pco-8 ShardTelemetry, locality enabled | **628,473,667** | **136.68x** | 81.511 | 1,005.02 |
| Pco-8 ShardTelemetry, locality disabled (initial default) | **628,473,667** | **136.68x** | **74.157** | **1,104.68** |
| Pco-8 ShardTelemetry, first optimized hot path | **628,473,667** | **136.68x** | **42.344** | **1,934.63** |
| ClickHouse 26.5.1.882 | 1,175,260,664 | 73.09x | 87.830 | 932.71 |

Storage accounting for both Pco legs:

| Component | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| Accepted Docker JSON source | 85,899,343,853 |
| Structural payload before zstd | 15,847,519,672 |
| zstd-1 pack payload | 627,654,450 |
| Manifest | 819,217 |
| Persistent term/field index | 0 in the direct corpus encoder |
| Compression dictionaries | 0 |
| Durable pack plus manifest | **628,473,667** |

Pco saved 197,890,344 durable bytes, or 23.95%, from the previous ShardTelemetry
format. It saved 546,786,997 bytes, or 46.53%, from ClickHouse's active-part
size. That first optimized path was 75.13% faster than the initial
locality-disabled Pco path and 107.42% faster than ClickHouse while preserving
every stored byte. The later path-by-path section records the current default.

Locality enabled and disabled produced byte-identical totals. The enabled leg
performed 528 splits, created 1,056 sub-blocks, suppressed 10,064 later split
explorations, transferred 83,512,504 membership bytes through `bytes-handoff`,
and reassigned zero records. It was 9.92% slower and missed the strict
throughput floor by 18.98 MiB/s. `CompressionLocalityConfig` therefore defaults
to disabled; the collator remains an explicit opt-in for heterogeneous
validation.

The final source state was archived and rebuilt independently after making
locality-disabled the hardcoded default. A 1 GiB invocation with no
`--locality` argument reported `locality routing: disabled`, reproduced the
same 7,946,802 durable bytes and 135.12x ratio, and passed all 128 payload
checksums plus sampled exact reconstruction. Its measured ingest throughput
was 951.80 MiB/s; this smoke run verifies default selection and stored bytes,
while the prewarmed full 80 GiB run above remains the acceptance throughput
measurement.

These are native pinned-core performance runs, not deterministic task-schedule
replays. Adam passed the deterministic-simulation Linux doctor, but both the
framework checkout and ShardTelemetry source state were dirty/uncommitted; the
retained source archive and binary hashes, rather than a Git revision, are the
reconstruction boundary.

## Pco-8 hot-path throughput optimization

Run date: 2026-07-29 America/New_York / 2026-07-30 UTC  
Host: Adam, Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8.0-111-generic  
CPUs: `0-15`, 16 workers  
Block target: 8 MiB  
Locality and real-time dictionary: disabled  
Evidence: `/home/dtietjen/shard-telemetry-head-to-head/throughput-optimization-20260729-v1`

Profiling showed that Pco and Zstd were no longer the throughput limit. The
initial path spent most of its CPU in repeated message scanning, metadata
hashing and allocation, Docker JSON normalization, and locality bookkeeping
that could not affect a disabled-routing result.

The accepted implementation:

1. Bypasses locality membership, grouping, and redistribution when routing is
   disabled. `LogStripe` now takes the same direct seal path and records zero
   collator observations.
2. Uses borrowed probes when building attribute tables, allocating a key or
   value only on its first occurrence.
3. Keeps a 1,024-entry direct-mapped, block-local message-layout cache. A hit
   requires exact message-byte equality; collisions only trigger reparsing.
4. Uses linear lookup through 16 entries for low-cardinality metadata, then
   promotes to the existing hash-table path for wider blocks.
5. Parses the Docker adapter's common fixed 30-byte RFC3339-nanosecond
   timestamp directly, retaining the general parser as fallback. OTLP already
   supplies a numeric timestamp and does not need this adapter step.

One representative 8 MiB source block contained 59,313 valid records but only
19 exact messages. Reusing parsed layouts therefore removes almost all
token-range allocation and template rescanning on this corpus without
special-casing message text.

### Sequential 1 GiB ablations

Each comparison alternated the two binaries on the same warm source and CPUs.
Runs are shorter than one second after optimization, so the table reports the
median within each paired experiment rather than comparing medians from
different experiments.

| Paired experiment | Control MiB/s | Candidate MiB/s | Change | Decision |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Disabled-locality and borrowed-attribute path | 963.06 | 1,007.48 | +4.61% | Keep |
| Exact-message layout cache | 1,020.76 | 1,615.83 | +58.30% | Keep |
| Low-cardinality metadata path | 1,606.19 | 1,668.87 | +3.90% | Keep |
| Fixed-width timestamp path | 1,646.44 | 1,697.75 | +3.12% | Keep |
| Canonical Docker JSON parser | 1,633.36 | 1,623.00 | -0.63% | Removed |
| Cheaper cache index plus buffer reservations | 1,711.52 | 1,696.48 | -0.88% | Removed |
| Buffer reservations with original cache index | 1,677.52 | 1,651.66 | -1.54% | Removed |

Every 1 GiB candidate produced exactly 7,946,802 durable bytes and passed all
128 block checksums plus sampled exact reconstruction.

### Final 80 GiB gate

| Metric | Initial Pco-8 default | Optimized default | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Durable bytes | 628,473,667 | **628,473,667** | identical |
| Compression ratio | 136.68x | **136.68x** | identical |
| Ingest seconds | 74.157 | **42.344** | -42.90% |
| Ingest throughput | 1,104.68 MiB/s | **1,934.63 MiB/s** | +75.13% |

The optimized run consumed 85,899,345,826 complete-line bytes, accepted
85,899,343,853 bytes and 607,363,459 records, rejected the same seven malformed
records totaling 1,973 bytes, and emitted 10,240 blocks. It reproduced the
existing component totals exactly: 15,847,519,672 structural bytes,
627,654,450 pack bytes, and an 819,217-byte manifest. All 10,240 payload
checksums passed, and first/middle/last sampled records reconstructed exactly.
External wall time was 43.19 seconds, with 524.34 user-seconds, 92.88
system-seconds, and 370,788 KiB maximum RSS.

Execution tier was native pinned multicore on Adam. This is host-level
performance evidence, not deterministic task-schedule replay. The
deterministic-simulation framework revisions were
`62f4e527284add129faf9d9d3bfd1ec99f65f26e` locally and
`bd1c4ba7eff99a5f324a5434b1a9d23444e32582` on Adam; both checkouts were dirty.
The ShardTelemetry repository was unborn/uncommitted, so retained archives and
binary hashes are the replay boundary.

## Current default — path-by-path single-core optimization

Run date: 2026-07-30  
Host: Adam, Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8.0-111-generic  
Single-core gates: `taskset -c 0`, one worker, prewarmed source  
Multicore gate: CPUs `0-15`, one worker per physical core  
Block target: 8 MiB  
Locality and real-time dictionary: disabled  
Evidence:
`/home/dtietjen/shard-telemetry-head-to-head/single-thread-optimization-20260730-v1`

The optimization pass treated ingestion as a sequence of independently
measurable costs:

```text
read immutable bytes
  -> discover complete lines
  -> parse Docker JSON and timestamps
  -> identify exact message layouts
  -> build structural columns
  -> encode Pco timestamps
  -> compress with zstd-1
  -> write/sync packs and manifest
```

Each candidate was built as a separate native binary and alternated with its
control on the same prewarmed 1 GiB source and CPU. Every accepted candidate
stored exactly 7,946,802 durable bytes in that gate and passed all 128 block
checksums plus sampled exact reconstruction. Percentages below are paired
measurements and must not be added together.

| Path component | Accepted change | Paired gain |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Line discovery | Scan newlines with `memchr` and retain borrowed ranges | +9.91% |
| Docker timestamp | Bound parsing to the known timestamp tail | +15.29% |
| Timestamp calendar prefix | Cache the repeated RFC3339 date/hour prefix | +13.34% |
| Timestamp fraction | Unroll the common nanosecond fraction | +2.54% |
| Docker adapter reuse | Cache exact normalized records | +2.19% |
| Structural layout | Cache exact parsed body layouts | +2.16% |
| Integer serialization | Add the common one-byte varint path | +2.63% |
| Pco model selection | Fix classic mode and first-order consecutive delta after a real-block probe | +3.18% |
| Template selection | Count work once per distinct layout | +1.82% |
| Layout cache lookup | Index with length plus first/last eight-byte samples; retain exact equality gate | +2.73% |
| Shared messages | Accept pointer-identical body slices before byte comparison | +1.58% |
| Timestamp fraction | Validate and fold eight ASCII digits with checked SWAR arithmetic | +1.69% |
| Body serialization | Pre-encode exact fragments for repeated layouts | +3.40% |
| Input transfer | Read-only `mmap` in the corpus harness, exposing borrowed worker slices | +10.62% |
| Layout working set | Store bounded per-record layout IDs as `u32` | +0.36% |

The medians advanced from approximately 499 MiB/s before this sequence to
1,031.55 MiB/s in the final paired 1 GiB cohort, a 2.07x one-core gain.
Independent 8 GiB validation reached 1,122.91 MiB/s (1.10 GiB/s) on one
physical core. The `mmap` change belongs only to the benchmark adapter; the
storage library remains safe Rust and accepts stable borrowed input from any
ingestion source.

The independent full 80 GiB one-core gate then reached 1,157.26 MiB/s in
70.7876 timed seconds and produced the same 628,417,043 durable bytes as the
16-core run. External process wall time was 75.40 seconds, including
verification and teardown. Its reported 83,915,148 KiB maximum RSS is
file-backed mapped corpus pages already present in the page cache, not an
80 GiB private heap requirement.

### Rejected candidates

Negative results were restored rather than accumulating speculative branches:

| Candidate | Result | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pco level 7 | 3.81% more stored bytes and 1.98% slower | Restore level 8 |
| Lighter Docker cache hash | 0.11% slower | Restore the stronger sampled hash |
| Canonical general Docker JSON parser | 0.63% slower | Keep specialized validated path plus fallback |
| Cheaper cache index plus broad reservations | 0.88% slower | Remove |
| Broad buffer reservations alone | 1.54% slower | Remove |

The fixed Pco model is not a corpus-assuming wire-format shortcut: Pco's
automatic mode probe selected the same classic/first-order model for every
sampled real block, and the fixed path retains lossless Pco framing. Exact
message comparisons similarly remain the authority behind all body cache hits.

### Current profile and remaining costs

An 8 GiB one-core `perf` run sustained 1,118.94 MiB/s. Approximate inclusive
samples in the timed hot path were:

| Cost center | Samples |
| --- | ---: |
| Structural encoding overall | 14.19% |
| Per-block processing/orchestration | 10.72% |
| Timestamp parsing | 6.43% |
| Newline search | 5.41% |
| Docker normalization cache | 5.09% |
| Pco histogram/model/binary/ANS/dissection work | 14.70% combined |
| zstd-1 | 3.50% |
| Attribute construction | 2.64% |
| Body encoding | 2.41% |
| Varints | 1.08% |

This changes the optimization priority. Pco is now the largest coherent CPU
consumer, but lowering its level failed both size and speed. The next useful
work is targeted internal Pco profiling or a purpose-built timestamp codec
that must beat its 7.02 bits/value result—not more message grouping on this
already repetitive corpus. The parser remains the next generic target:
fusing newline discovery with Docker framing, reducing timestamp fallback
branches, and accepting native OTLP timestamps without RFC3339 conversion.

### Physical-core scaling

All rows used the same prewarmed 8 GiB prefix, 8 MiB blocks, durable
pack/manifest output, and post-ingest verification:

| Physical cores | MiB/s | GiB/s | Scale from one core |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 1,122.91 | 1.10 | 1.00x |
| 2 | 1,491.85 | 1.46 | 1.33x |
| 4 | 2,695.98 | 2.63 | 2.40x |
| 8 | 5,008.73 | 4.89 | 4.46x |
| 16 | 6,999.68 | 6.84 | 6.23x |

CPUs `0-15` are separate physical cores on Adam; SMT siblings are `16-31`.
Scaling is intentionally reported rather than called linear: shared memory
bandwidth, page cache, filesystem synchronization, and per-core turbo become
visible above one worker.

### Authoritative full 80 GiB head-to-head

The final sequential harness prewarmed the immutable source separately before
each engine. ShardTelemetry and ClickHouse 26.5.1.882 each received CPUs `0-15`.
ShardTelemetry synchronized 16 pack files and its manifest before stopping the
timer. ClickHouse enabled `fsync_after_insert`; the harness flushed the table
and measured active-part bytes. Both accepted 607,363,459 records spanning
85,899,343,853 source bytes.

| Engine | Durable bytes | Ratio | Seconds | MiB/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **ShardTelemetry current default** | **628,417,043** | **136.69x** | **10.8206** | **7,570.75** |
| ClickHouse 26.5.1.882 | 1,175,169,126 | 73.10x | 88.3300 | 927.43 |

ShardTelemetry was 8.16x as fast and used 546,752,083 fewer bytes, a 46.52%
reduction from ClickHouse's stored size. Its storage comprised 627,597,826
compressed payload bytes and an 819,217-byte manifest; structural data before
zstd was 15,847,462,930 bytes. The result is 56,624 bytes smaller than the
first Pco-8 optimized implementation and 3.91x its full-corpus throughput.
All 10,240 payload checksums passed and sampled first/middle/last records
decompressed and reconstructed exactly.

This is native Linux host-performance evidence, not logical or exact
task-schedule replay. The deterministic-simulation framework revisions were
`62f4e527284add129faf9d9d3bfd1ec99f65f26e` locally and
`bd1c4ba7eff99a5f324a5434b1a9d23444e32582` on Adam; both framework
checkouts were dirty. The ShardTelemetry repository was unborn/uncommitted, so the
retained source archive and binary hashes are the reconstruction boundary.

## Real-time dictionary learning

Run date: 2026-07-29 local  
Host: Apple silicon, macOS 26.5, Darwin 25.5.0  
Rust: 1.93.0  
Zstd crate: 0.13.3  
Workers: 8  
Locality: disabled  
Evidence: `/private/tmp/shard-telemetry-realtime-dictionary-local-20260729-v1`

### What was tested

The learner samples only the exact structural lanes that can contribute
reusable Zstd vocabulary: templates, encoded bodies, attribute tables, and
fields. It excludes offset and Pco timestamp sections. One background worker
trains a 64 KiB candidate from 4 MiB of bounded samples. Later observations
are shadow-compressed in 16-block batches. Admission accumulates actual
held-out savings until they repay the dictionary plus a 16 KiB minimum net
gain; a losing candidate or one that cannot repay itself within 256 MiB of
observed structural data is rejected.

The source began with 26,393,298 bytes of genuine local install, Wi-Fi, and
launchd text logs. A lossless adapter emitted 175,169 Docker JSON records
totaling 38,672,775 bytes:

```text
4532294b8931bacd26692f4d5d52163e5dea7fa3937bf574a8eff5bbd78bf850
```

That adapted corpus was repeated 28 times, preserving its internal order, to
create a 1,082,837,700-byte stationary stream:

```text
2a92f487711c1515d35e1ebe5066c0a39ce67868f27bdcc73151f1f7277581ff
```

The benchmark consumed the largest complete-line prefix at 1 GiB:
1,073,741,627 bytes and 4,862,297 records. Repetition intentionally provides a
long stable lifetime in which a live dictionary can repay training; it does
not represent 1 GiB of independent production events.

### 512 KiB blocks

Both modes wrote 2,048 independent blocks, synchronized eight pack files and
the ordered manifest, verified all 2,048 payload checksums, and exactly
reconstructed sampled first, middle, and last blocks.

| Mode | Pack bytes | Manifest/assignments | Dictionary | Durable bytes | Ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Disabled | 45,111,026 | 163,857 | 0 | 45,274,883 | 23.72x |
| Real-time | 42,871,929 | 163,970 | 65,536 | **43,101,435** | **24.91x** |

The online generation saved 2,173,448 durable bytes, or 4.80%, after charging
both the immutable dictionary and three sparse assignment runs. The final run
observed all 2,048 blocks, dropped 183 training observations from its bounded
queue without ingestion backpressure, trained two candidates, published one,
and rejected one. Shadow evaluation compressed 2,812,417 baseline bytes to
2,662,420 candidate bytes. Training and evaluation consumed 0.146 and 0.043
CPU-seconds respectively.

Three prewarmed disabled runs measured 1,448.59 MiB/s median. The corresponding
online implementation measured 1,358.87 MiB/s median, 6.19% lower but 334.87
MiB/s above the 1 GiB/s gate. The online publication boundary is asynchronous:
repeated runs differed slightly in how many already-sealed blocks adopted the
generation. This changes compression efficiency, never reconstruction or
dictionary identity. The final sparse-sidecar run above is the durable byte
accounting result.

### 8 MiB control

| Mode | Pack bytes | Manifest/assignments | Dictionary | Durable bytes | Ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Disabled | 38,826,286 | 10,257 | 0 | **38,836,543** | **27.65x** |
| Real-time | 38,826,286 | 10,257 | 0 | **38,836,543** | **27.65x** |

The candidate reduced sampled held-out frames from 3,678,051 to 3,638,588
bytes, but that 39,463-byte gross gain did not repay a 65,536-byte dictionary
within the 256 MiB observation cap. The learner rejected it, emitted no
dictionary object or assignment file, and produced byte-identical durable
storage. This is the intended fail-open behavior.

The larger dictionary-free blocks still beat 512 KiB dictionary-backed blocks
on ratio (27.65x versus 24.91x). A real-time dictionary is useful when query
latency or bounded decode amplification requires small independent blocks; it
does not supersede larger blocks where those are acceptable.

These local runs are native parallel performance measurements, not
deterministic task-schedule replays and not substitutes for Adam acceptance.
Adam became unreachable because the client had no DNS configuration before
the final exact-lane archive could be deployed. The retained Adam 1 GiB
message-body and mixed-structural precursors both rejected their candidates
and left pack payload bytes unchanged. The remaining acceptance run is the
final exact-lane learner on the immutable 80 GiB corpus with CPUs `0-15`, plus
the non-repeated Pluribus/Eden/OTEL interleaving.

### Hot stripe

The original implementation converted the first posting to a hash set and
called linear `Vec::contains` for every later constraint. Query term order
therefore changed latency, and a three-term query became quadratic.

The optimized path uses borrowed nested partition maps, offset windows,
selectivity ordering, sorted merge/galloping intersections, ordered
partition postings, reference-only results, and early ordering/limits. Adam
used CPU 0, 100,000 records, and 20 measured iterations:

| 100-offset window | not available | 13.00 us | bounded |

The two term orders now have equivalent cost. The miss path remained below
100 ns. Evidence files are `hot-baseline-100k.txt` and
`hot-sorted-postings-v2-100k.txt`.

### First persistent 1 GiB result

The first persistent implementation used 128 independently compressed 8 MiB
blocks and an exact term/metadata index:

| Component | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| Source | 1,073,741,671 |
| Structural | 198,142,239 |
| Pack payload | 7,936,545 |
| Manifest | 10,257 |
| Query index | 1,407,758 |
| Total durable | 9,354,560 |

This is 114.78x total compression. The query index added 17.7% over the tiny
pack payload but only 0.13% of raw source bytes. All 128 checksums and sampled
exact reconstruction checks passed. Index-enabled ingest sustained 762.12
MiB/s, below the 1 GiB/s acceptance floor and therefore not the final default
result.

Warm exact queries returned 100 records from one block:

| Query | Plan | Read + zstd + selective decode |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| newest 100, no filter | 11.18 us | 2.717 ms |
| term `cannot` | 2.52 us | 2.537 ms |
| five-term error AND | 32.96 us | 2.560 ms |
| `docker.stream=stderr` | 12.22 us | 2.781 ms |
| missing term | 0.08 us | 0.10 us |

The corresponding cached-structural measurements were 2.31–2.61 ms, proving
that payload I/O and zstd were not the primary cost. `perf` attributed 27.24%
to UTF-8 validation, 24.13% to body walking, 15.73% to field walking, 13.35%
to varints, 5.80% to offset/Pco decoding, 2.27% to zstd, and 1.14% to pack
reads. Evidence includes `persistent-index-1g-v3-report.txt`,
`pack-*-v3.txt`, and `pack-query-v3-perf.data`.

### Checkpointed selective decoding

A 256-record seek footer now follows each structural body and field lane.
Directories are appended after the original record bytes so the compressible
payload remains byte-identical at the front. The strict full decoder verifies
every checkpoint against an actual record boundary.

The same deterministic synthetic block was built with the archived v3 source
and the current source:

| Metric | Scan-all v3 | Checkpoint footer |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Records | 60,000 | 60,000 |
| Structural bytes | 5,580,222 | 5,581,410 |
| zstd-1 bytes | 148,554 | 148,562 |
| Full decode | 15.25 ms | 15.24 ms |
| Newest contiguous 100 | 2.684 ms | about 0.175 ms |
| Every 100th record, 100 hits | not measured | about 0.460 ms |

The contiguous selective path improved about 15x while adding only eight
compressed bytes in this test. The current `shard-telemetry-selective-decode-bench`
also measures query-index construction. Message/term direct maps, recycled
term-ID vectors, duplicate-safe last-ordinal checks, and removal of a
per-record metadata set increased that synthetic build rate from 742,463 to
approximately 1.14 million records/s per core.

Persistent postings now retain dense runs after decode instead of expanding
them into complete ordinal vectors. `shard-telemetry-pack-query-bench` reports both
logical posting cardinality and resident posting-array/run bytes. On this
synthetic block, 1,736,000 logical ordinals occupied 1,452,352 resident bytes
instead of 6,944,000 bytes as a flat `u32` representation, a 79.1% reduction
for posting payload storage. A dense two-constraint newest-first plan with a
100-record limit took about 0.35 microseconds locally because it walks runs
backward and stops as soon as the limit is satisfied.

The checkpoint/index-memory candidate has passed the complete local test suite
and warning-denied Clippy. A final Adam result requires rebuilding the
1 GiB pack in the new single pre-release structural format; the older v3 pack
cannot be queried by the new decoder.

### Complete lookup-contract benchmark

Run date: 2026-07-30  
Command:
`cargo run --release --bin shard-telemetry-query-bench -- --records 100000 --iterations 100`
Environment: local arm64 release build, one `LogStripe`

This run exercises the complete lookup contract added after the original
posting optimization. Timings include result-reference collection and cloning
complete matching records.

| Query | Matches | Mean |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Rare token | 100 | 5.42 us |
| Newest common, limit 100 | 100 | 5.39 us |
| Newest all, limit 100 | 100 | 5.19 us |
| 100-offset window | 100 | 4.88 us |
| Common AND rare | 100 | 14.77 us |
| Rare AND common | 100 | 14.70 us |
| Common AND medium AND rare | 100 | 22.52 us |
| Exact field AND rare | 50 | 8.71 us |
| Missing token | 0 | 0.069 us |
| Common AND (error OR rare) | 25,000 | 32.95 ms |
| Message contains | 100 | 9.51 ms |
| Message regex | 100 | 5.35 ms |
| Field exists | 100,000 | 18.71 ms |
| Field set membership | 12,500 | 8.48 ms |
| Numeric field comparison | 10,000 | 9.11 ms |
| Newest timestamp, limit 100 | 100 | 6.33 ms |
| Offset cursor, next 100 | 100 | 3.32 ms |

The first nine rows are posting or ordered-window plans. The remaining rows
are exact residual scans over 100,000 records; broad rows also clone every
returned record. The planner deliberately returns a safe superset for those
operators and does not consume the query limit until after residual filtering.
Index construction for the same fixture sustained 868,818 records/s.

Compatibility is tested across nested Boolean expressions, every literal text
mode, message and field regex, field existence and set membership, all signed
integer comparisons, non-monotonic timestamp ranges and ordering, stable
cursors, and selected/all-stripe fan-out. The same expected offsets must be
returned by the hot stripe and by persistent-index candidates round-tripped
through the structural encoder and decoder.

## Historical sealed/cold baseline versus ClickHouse — 80 GiB

Run date: 2026-07-30  
Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
Evidence:
`/home/dtietjen/shard-telemetry-query-head-to-head/cold-current-v2-20260730T221500Z`

This run answers the non-hot-record case. It reused the verified
607,363,459-row ShardTelemetry pack and ClickHouse snapshot from the indexed 80 GiB
campaign. Both engines ran sequentially on physical CPUs `0-15`. Search
indexes remained resident; immediately before each cold sample the harness
used `POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED` on ShardTelemetry pack files and ClickHouse's immutable
`time`, `stream`, and `log` payload files. ClickHouse's result and query caches
were disabled. This is a local-SSD payload-cold comparison, not a remote
object-store latency measurement.

Every query first emitted timestamp, stream, and message results. The harness
required byte-identical ShardTelemetry and ClickHouse files before timing. Warm rows
use 20 iterations and cold rows use five, except the deliberately expensive
substring miss, which uses one.

| Lookup, limit 100 | ShardTelemetry warm p50 | ClickHouse warm p50 | ShardTelemetry cold p50 | ClickHouse cold p50 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Latest | **1.055 ms** | 508 ms | **1.414 ms** | 666 ms |
| `docker.stream=stderr` | **1.054 ms** | 5 ms | **1.396 ms** | 21 ms |
| Token `cannot` | **1.237 ms** | 529 ms | **1.633 ms** | 689 ms |
| Five-token AND | **1.994 ms** | 568 ms | **2.355 ms** | 729 ms |
| Missing token | **0.00020 ms** | 11 ms | **0.00042 ms** | 11 ms |
| Message contains, positive | **75.613 ms** | 583 ms | **76.367 ms** | 764 ms |
| Message regex, positive | **72.193 ms** | 597 ms | **72.892 ms** | 788 ms |
| Message contains, missing | 35,930 ms | **1,672 ms** | 35,918 ms | **1,885 ms** |

Indexed ShardTelemetry reads one block and remains within about 1.4-2.4 ms at cold
p50. Cold latest is 471x faster, the favorable ClickHouse stream lookup is
15x faster, positive contains is 10.0x faster, and positive regex is 10.8x
faster. A missing token is rejected by resident postings without a payload
read.

The missing substring reverses the result: ClickHouse is 19.1x faster cold.
Neither engine can reject it with the configured text index, but ClickHouse
scans its body column vectorially. ShardTelemetry's 16-worker fallback currently
decodes complete structural records across all 10,240 blocks. It processes the
corpus in 35.92 seconds without constructing a corpus-wide candidate vector,
but body-only predicate pushdown and block-level n-gram rejection are now the
highest-value query optimizations.

Payload temperature is not ShardTelemetry's largest indexed-query problem. The
current global index still takes 23.13-23.23 seconds to load and expands its
113,853,148-byte file into 17,071,691,984 bytes of resident posting storage.
The latency table excludes this one-time process startup for both long-lived
engines. Segmented mmap-friendly postings are required to remove that cold
start and make object-tier serving production-ready.

The source archive is identified by SHA-256
`41e96972ba58c86476edc05d7428047f4546669f6d0fcc69a0ec0b98dae772f2`;

`5f77f147bdfa7e259c451c207745964b046002772cf4904fdc113c3e5192c158`.
The ShardTelemetry repository is still unborn, so those content hashes—not a commit
ID—identify the tested source. The ClickHouse image remained pinned to
`sha256:770156c537ca9124046e138a3b5845c64ea58ce8722de7a2e05fd827f4976520`.

## Block-trigram substring rejection — 80 GiB

Run date: 2026-07-30  
Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
Final query evidence:
`/home/dtietjen/shard-telemetry-query-head-to-head/cold-trigram-v5-20260730T185500Z`
Final ingest evidence:
`/home/dtietjen/shard-telemetry-query-head-to-head/missing-substring-v5-build-20260730T185600Z`

The `SLOGQIX2` query directory adds one 65,536-bit lowercase message-trigram
filter per 8 MiB source block. Filters are necessary-condition metadata:
missing bits reject blocks, while present bits still require the existing
exact decoded-record predicate. Hash collisions can add work but cannot hide
records. Only message literals required by the query's conjunction are used;
OR and NOT branches remain fail-open.

The resident directory stores all filters in one contiguous 80 MiB allocation.
Two derived 8 KiB masks avoid touching it in the common extremes. A missing
bit in the global union rejects the entire corpus, while bits in the global
intersection prove that every block is a candidate. The latter recovered the
positive-query cache behavior that was lost in the first block-major
implementation.

### Implementation ablation

All rows used the same 10,240 blocks, 607,363,459 records, 16 physical CPUs,
and byte-identical positive/negative results.

| Version | Missing contains cold p50 | Positive contains warm p50 | Positive contains cold p50 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| No trigram metadata | 35,918 ms | 79.595 ms | 80.826 ms |
| Block filters, scan every block | 0.885 ms | 89.578 ms | 89.059 ms |
| Union/intersection, boxed block filters | 0.00091 ms | 87.400 ms | 86.934 ms |
| Union/intersection, contiguous block filters | **0.00091 ms** | **80.487 ms** | **81.770 ms** |

The final positive path is within 1.2% of the sequential no-filter control,
while the cold full miss is about 39.5 million times faster and reads no
payload. The intermediate boxed layout is retained only as benchmark evidence;
the pre-release code has one current format and one contiguous resident
layout.

### Final sequential ClickHouse comparison

Both engines ran sequentially on physical CPUs `0-15`. The harness kept search
indexes resident, evicted immutable payload pages before each cold sample,
disabled ClickHouse result/query/filesystem caches, and required byte-identical
timestamp, stream, and message output before timing. Warm rows use 20
iterations and cold rows use five.

| Lookup, limit 100 | ShardTelemetry warm p50 | ClickHouse warm p50 | ShardTelemetry cold p50 | ClickHouse cold p50 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Latest | **1.336 ms** | 511 ms | **1.776 ms** | 663 ms |
| `docker.stream=stderr` | **1.346 ms** | 5 ms | **1.788 ms** | 21 ms |
| Token `cannot` | **1.511 ms** | 527 ms | **1.942 ms** | 694 ms |
| Five-token AND | **2.181 ms** | 567 ms | **2.617 ms** | 718 ms |
| Missing token | **0.00020 ms** | 11 ms | **0.00043 ms** | 12 ms |
| Message contains, positive | **79.131 ms** | 581 ms | **86.284 ms** | 753 ms |
| Message regex, positive | **79.259 ms** | 596 ms | **78.998 ms** | 775 ms |
| Message contains, missing | **0.00091 ms** | 1,624 ms | **0.00091 ms** | 1,794 ms |

Cold ShardTelemetry is 8.7x faster for the positive substring and about 1.97 million
times faster for the missing substring. Regex receives no trigram pruning in
this version; its 9.8x cold advantage comes from stopping after the first
matching block.

Every one of the eight ShardTelemetry result files has the same SHA-256 as its
ClickHouse counterpart. The missing result is the canonical empty-file digest
`e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`;
the positive substring pair is
`173edb4e10771f7d0ea9bdc54e02fb013a9ceaa9c00423aa979b2c28ff0dd128`.

### Ingest and storage cost

The final source rebuilt the complete immutable corpus and verified all 10,240
payload checksums plus first/middle/last record reconstruction in every block.

| Metric | No trigram metadata | Final trigram directory | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| End-to-end indexed ingest | 2,311.95 MiB/s | 2,147.10 MiB/s | -7.1% |
| Ingest elapsed | 35.433 s | 38.154 s | +7.7% |
| Compressed query index | 113,853,148 B | 114,420,962 B | +567,814 B |
| Pack + manifest + index | 743,581,572 B | 744,149,386 B | +567,814 B |
| Source-to-total ratio | 115.52x | 115.43x | -0.08% |
| Peak RSS | 102,406,520 KiB | 102,389,728 KiB | effectively unchanged |

The raw filters occupy 83,886,080 bytes resident but their repetitive bit
patterns add only 567,814 compressed bytes: 0.50% of the prior index and
0.00066% of the source corpus. Indexed ingest remains 2.10x above the 1 GiB/s
acceptance floor.

The Adam-tested implementation archive SHA-256 is

## Native protocol versus Loki JSON adapter — 1 GiB

Run date: 2026-07-30  
Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
Evidence: `/home/dtietjen/shard-telemetry-native-ab-v7`

This sequential ablation compares ShardTelemetry's native binary protocol with its
Loki-compatible JSON push boundary. It is not a ShardTelemetry-versus-Loki-engine
comparison. Both legs used the same final release server and loader, CPUs
`0-15`, 16 physical/index stripes, 16 persistent client connections, 1 MiB
target batches, indexed acknowledgements, fresh directories, and the same
1,073,741,933 source bytes (7,592,023 records) from the immutable 80 GiB
corpus.

| Protocol | Elapsed | Source throughput | Client wire bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Native grouped TCP | **14.959744 s** | **68.45 MiB/s** | **832,404,552** |
| Loki HTTP JSON | 17.000543 s | 60.23 MiB/s | 953,863,512 |

The native protocol improved end-to-end durable-and-indexed ingestion by
13.6% and reduced client-to-server bytes by 12.7%. It stores labels once per
stream, uses fixed-width timestamps and counts, and decodes directly into
normalized events with stream label fields shared through `Arc`. It avoids
HTTP headers, JSON parsing/escaping, `LokiEntry` maps, and OTLP protobuf
transcoding.

| Durable component | Native | Loki JSON |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| shard-stream data | 832,597,320 B | 832,630,024 B |
| Sink recovery journal | 832,481,480 B | 832,502,536 B |
| Total | 1,665,078,800 B | 1,665,132,560 B |

The durable outputs differ by only 53,760 bytes because the Loki adapter
converts accepted entries into the same native grouped representation before
append. Both server logs were empty. Binary SHA-256 identifiers:

- server:
  `ba6ed14975058087792a1b54a7c5937fe6fbd202788055894d101d7c972cd8d5`
- loader:
  `0d4b3dbb049b8a5bc9f1133bda9d33f716304c1d461e1b3c83e78570177b0504`

Those hashes identify the timed binaries. The subsequent restart gate found
that one logical partition can migrate between physical owner shards, so
journal recovery now merges all stripe journals by
`(topic, partition, placement sequence)` before replay. The current server
binary
`88dbbb3bcc5f9861bc4cc17e2ada0394a7d09b7af7b1eecc8049757b342561cc`
reopened the retained 1 GiB native directory, replayed all 7,592,023 records,
and became ready in approximately 32 seconds with an empty recovery log. The
current loader binary is
`5e486ffe4e0f0e9aea729021369c070b214650872c70700ba4871acfff4b23d8`.
The replay remains single-threaded and is now an explicit startup-throughput
optimization target.

The run also exposed and fixed an offset invariant at the shard-stream
boundary. Offsets are lane-global and strictly increasing for a logical
partition, but may contain gaps occupied by sibling partitions. ShardTelemetry now
accepts monotonic gaps while preserving exact IDs and rejecting duplicates or
regressions. A three-batch durable/restart test covers this behavior.

The complete 80 GiB protocol comparison is intentionally deferred. With
compressed block publication and WAL/journal reclamation still open, each
current durable leg retains approximately two copies of its native payload;
running both full legs would consume most of Adam's remaining space and would
measure a known temporary storage path rather than the production design.

## Compression-derived durable index — 1 GiB production path

Run date: 2026-07-30  
Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
CPUs: physical cores `0-15`, shared by server and native loader  
Corpus: 1,073,741,933 source bytes and 7,592,023 complete records from the
immutable 80 GiB corpus  
Protocol: native grouped TCP, 16 owner stripes, 16 persistent connections,
1 MiB target batches, indexed acknowledgements  
Recovery journal: disabled; the checksummed compressed ingest pack is the
authoritative shard-stream payload

This run replaces the production path's decoded-record map and independent
term/field postings with the index built by structural compression itself.
Live handoff carries only the encoded index section. Restart recovers that
section from the compressed frame.

### Durable ingest

| Configuration | Elapsed | Source throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Pipeline depth 1 | 1.961421 s | 522.07 MiB/s |
| Pipeline depth 4 | 1.641291 s | 623.90 MiB/s |
| Pipeline depth 8, initial frame descriptor | 1.619862 s | 632.15 MiB/s |
| Pipeline depth 16 | 1.619783 s | 632.18 MiB/s |
| 32 connections, pipeline depth 4 | 1.666580 s | 614.43 MiB/s |
| **Final timestamp-aware frame, pipeline depth 8** | **1.601187 s** | **639.53 MiB/s** |

The pipeline-depth plateau is between 8 and 16; adding connections did not
improve it. The final run is 9.34x the retained 68.45 MiB/s native service row
above. Even the depth-one result is 7.63x that row, so pipelining is not the
source of the architectural gain.

Final durable storage was 9,892,892 bytes, or **108.54x** source-to-disk
compression (0.9213% retained). This total includes shard-stream pack
envelopes, coordinator metadata, and manifests. For context, the matching
structural-only 1 GiB run stored 8,362,652 bytes at 128.40x; durable framing
therefore adds about 1.53 MB. Server RSS after the ingest and query series was
373,256 KiB. That is a settled observation, not a sampled peak.

### Exact native query latency

Query: label `source=clickhouse-docker`, token `runnableEntry`, a 60-second
timestamp range covering the loaded data, newest first, limit 10. Every
response contained the same 10 records and 1,080-byte native payload.

| Coordinator/index stage | Mean | p50 | p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Per-partition fanout, scan all positive frames | 724.939 ms | 724.280 ms | 737.362 ms |
| One batched fanout per stripe | 568.122 ms | 567.767 ms | 586.321 ms |
| **Batched fanout + frame min/max top-K** | **12.682 ms** | **11.307 ms** | **16.708 ms** |
| Missing token, final path | **0.314 ms** | **0.313 ms** | **0.343 ms** |

Frame bounds make the positive limited lookup 44.8x faster than batching
alone. A missing token opens no compressed frame. A stop/reopen cycle rebuilt
the embedded indexes from the authoritative packs, reported ready, and
returned the same 10-record exact result.

The Loki-compatible substring query `|= "runnableEntry"` remains a residual
scan in this frame-index implementation. It took 19.26 seconds before the
top-K work because arbitrary substring literals cannot safely use whole-token
locators. Folding the existing bounded trigram rejection into the embedded
frame index is required before this path replaces the older sealed-query
directory for all LogQL predicates.

### Profile

A 4 GiB profiled run sustained 547.29 MiB/s under `perf` instrumentation.
Largest server self-costs were:

| Symbol/category | Self cycles |
| --- | ---: |
| Structural field encoding | 7.82% |
| UTF-8 validation | 6.87% |
| Structural/index orchestration | 6.78% |
| BLAKE3 hashing | 5.50% |
| Native event decode | 5.27% |
| Free + malloc | 4.76% |
| Attribute value counting | 2.49% |
| Zstandard block compression | 1.46% |

Compression itself is no longer the production bottleneck. The next write-path
optimization should parse native records into borrowed structural views,
eliminating owned-string construction and the corresponding UTF-8/allocation
work before changing codecs.

### Final full 80 GiB durable run

The final format and service path completed the complete immutable corpus with
indexed acknowledgements:

| Source retained | 0.9085% |
| Durable files | 1,842 |
| Open descriptors after ingest | 44 |
| Peak server RSS | 2,240,432 KiB |
| Peak loader RSS | 273,828 KiB |

The first full attempt exposed an unbounded shard-stream `pack_readers` map:
every rolled pack retained a `File`, reaching Adam's 1,024 soft descriptor
limit after 991 files. A bounded per-shard cache fixed live ingest but still
multiplied its capacity by 16 shards during recovery. The final implementation
opens immutable pack readers on demand and closes them after each coalesced
read. A dedicated 81-pack append/reopen/fetch test and the full run verify the
fix. The complete run finished with 44 descriptors despite 1,842 durable
files.

Full-corpus native query results:

| Exact query, limit 10 | Mean | p50 | p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `source=clickhouse-docker AND runnableEntry` | **12.890 ms** | **12.978 ms** | **16.485 ms** |
| Missing token | **1.658 ms** | **1.626 ms** | **2.296 ms** |

Cold reopen reconstructed all frame indexes, became ready within a measured
25.1-second upper bound, held 44 descriptors, and returned the same exact
10-record result. Recovered RSS was 1,869,216 KiB before that query.

Using the retained same-corpus, same-host, same-CPU ClickHouse and Loki rows
above, the now-production-shaped comparison is:

| Engine | Durable/settled bytes | Ratio | Throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **ShardTelemetry compressed-frame index** | **780,387,953** | **110.07x** | **669.45 MiB/s** |
| Loki 3.7.2 | 3,782,890,631 | 22.71x | 83.87 MiB/s |
| ClickHouse + text index | 6,093,155,990 | 14.10x | 353.33 MiB/s |

ShardTelemetry stored 4.85x fewer bytes than Loki and 7.81x fewer than ClickHouse.
It ingested 7.98x faster than Loki and 1.89x faster than ClickHouse. These
comparison rows share corpus, Adam host, and physical CPU set, but were
executed as retained sequential campaigns rather than one newly rerun
three-engine script.

## Borrowed native decode — single-core durable path

Run date: 2026-07-30  
Host: Adam, AMD Ryzen 9 3950X, Linux 6.8  
Server affinity: CPU `0` only; all server threads inherited that affinity  
Loader affinity: physical CPUs `1-15`, outside the measured server core  
Corpus: the complete immutable 80 GiB ClickHouse Docker JSON corpus, SHA-256
`4fd6379bd89fcb44688a3ebd611729416c82f110fbf49ffef905d9df0ebf0508`  
Protocol: native grouped TCP, one owner stripe, 16 persistent loader
connections, 1 MiB batches, pipeline depth 8, indexed acknowledgements

The production native path no longer materializes a `Vec<OtlpLogEvent>` before
structural encoding. A bounded parser retains bodies and values as slices of
the native frame, stores compact record/metadata descriptors, allocates
normalized label keys once per stream and metadata keys once per batch, and
feeds those records directly into the existing structural encoder. The `SLW1`
storage format did not change.

A unit ablation requires the borrowed and old owned paths to produce
byte-identical durable packs and transient embedded indexes for multiple
streams, Unicode, zero/one/multiple metadata fields, and different cohorts.
All 99 library tests and every binary test passed on macOS and Linux; Clippy
also passed with warnings denied.

### Full 80 GiB result

| Metric | Owned events | Borrowed native | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Source bytes | 85,899,345,920 | 85,899,345,920 | identical |
| Accepted records | 607,363,459 | 607,363,459 | identical |
| Native wire bytes | 66,592,152,397 | 66,592,152,397 | identical |
| Ingest elapsed | 275.756479 s | **229.309520 s** | 16.84% lower |
| Source throughput | 297.07 MiB/s | **357.25 MiB/s** | **20.26% higher** |
| Durable bytes | 780,372,593 | 780,372,593 | byte-identical total |
| Compression ratio | 110.0748x | 110.0748x | identical |
| Peak server RSS | 2,312,628 KiB | **2,205,552 KiB** | 4.63% lower |
| Server threads after ingest | 151 | 136 | 15 fewer |

Both full runs kept the entire server on one physical core and reported no
server, loader, or query errors. The loader remained outside CPU 0 and was not
the measured server-core budget. The 1 GiB gate improved from 284.12 to
333.58 MiB/s while producing the same 9,877,532 durable bytes.

Cold reopen of the borrowed result became ready within a measured 9.848-second
upper bound, held 14 descriptors, and returned the same exact 10 records.
Across 100 recovered queries, `source=clickhouse-docker AND runnableEntry`,
newest first, limit 10, measured 12.211 ms mean, 12.182 ms p50, and 12.925 ms
p99.

### Single-core profile

The 4 GiB `perf` run collected 6,328 cycle samples with zero lost and sustained
329.32 MiB/s under sampling, versus 284.41 MiB/s for the owned profile.

| Profile category | Owned path | Borrowed path |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Native decode, inclusive cycles | 30.26% | **20.58%** |
| Native decoder entry, self cycles | 7.61% | **3.42%** |
| Temporary `Vec` destruction, self cycles | 2.72% | below 0.20% |
| `malloc`, self cycles | 2.66% | **0.47%** |

Inclusive native decode fell 31.99%. The remaining borrowed decode total is
mostly required UTF-8 validation and cursor traversal: `from_utf8` was 7.86%
self, `Cursor::string` 6.23%, and `Cursor::string16` 0.77%. The generic
borrowed `record_field` accessor is now visible at 6.01% self because the
multi-pass structural encoder repeatedly resolves batch, stream, and metadata
indexes. BLAKE3 transport verification was 8.82% self. Structural encoding is
now the dominant inclusive stage at 57.42%; Zstandard was 4.32% inclusive.

An independent 8 GiB confirmation collected 12,764 cycle samples with zero
lost and sustained 325.34 MiB/s under DWARF call-graph sampling. A separate
counter-only run sustained 324.16 MiB/s. Both runs pinned the complete server
to CPU 0 and kept the loader on CPUs 1-15.

| Current borrowed-path category | Inclusive cycles | Self cycles |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Native pack preparation | 58.33% | 2.30% |
| Indexed structural encoding | 56.86% | 6.54% |
| Field lane encoding | 19.49% | 8.56% |
| Native batch decode and validation | 21.18% | 3.88% |
| `Cursor::string` | 13.94% | 6.54% |
| UTF-8 validation | 7.62% | 7.61% |
| Borrowed `record_field` lookup | 6.43% | 6.42% |
| BLAKE3 transport verification | 8.62% | 8.61% |
| Pco timestamp compression | 8.44% | distributed |
| Zstandard structural compression | 3.79% | distributed |

Inclusive rows overlap and must not be added. The counter run measured
86,168,709,058 cycles and 203,464,785,768 instructions for 8,589,934,670 source
bytes: 10.031 cycles/source-byte, 23.686 instructions/source-byte, 2.36 IPC,
0.89% branch misses, and 11.04% reported cache misses. At the measured
3.475 GHz clock, 1 GiB/s permits 3.236 cycles/source-byte, so the current path
still needs about a 3.10x reduction in CPU work to reach that target on this
core. The run had no CPU migrations, but its one-request-per-`spawn_blocking`
execution model reached 153 threads and 12,375 context switches/second.

The next write-path priorities are therefore:

1. Make normalized field IDs part of the validated native view and carry them
   through the attribute-table and field-lane passes. This removes repeated
   `record_field` resolution and repeated byte comparisons from the largest
   structural substage.
2. Fuse UTF-8 validation with the message/term scan, or adopt a measured SIMD
   validator for bodies while keeping malformed input fail-closed.
3. Evaluate hardware CRC32C for native transport corruption detection while
   retaining strong checksums for authoritative durable bytes.
4. Reuse a bounded Pco timestamp plan, or ablate a delta/bit-packed timestamp
   lane, without changing exact timestamp reconstruction or stored size.
5. Replace one `spawn_blocking` operation per pipelined request with one
   bounded worker per stripe to remove scheduler and thread-pool churn.
6. Leave Zstandard tuning until the larger field, validation, checksum, and
   timestamp costs have been reduced.

Because the pre-release repository still has no commit, these digests and the
binary hashes retained in each run are the reconstruction identities; the
run must not be described as reconstructable from a Git revision alone.

## Single-pass structural field encoding

The 2026-07-31 structural optimization resolves every input field once and
passes compact key/value IDs to the field encoder. The native view walks its
segmented tenant, label, and metadata storage directly. A fixed pointer-identity
cache handles immutable repeated keys and values, while exact byte lookup
remains the miss path. The large miss path is kept out of line and the repeated
value path is inlined.

The serialized structural format did not change. A focused test asserts that
the generic encoder reads each field exactly once. The existing native/owned
equivalence test still produces byte-identical ingest packs. A deterministic
one-worker Adam ablation over 1 GiB emitted 128 compressed blocks that were
byte-identical between the old and new encoders; every block checksum passed,
and sampled first/middle/last blocks reconstructed exactly.

### 8 GiB ablations

All production-path trials pinned the complete server to CPU 0, kept the
loader on CPUs 1-15, used one shard, 16 loader workers, pipeline depth 8, and
1 MiB native batches. Short 1 GiB trials were rejected as too noisy.

| Implementation | Runs | Mean MiB/s | Change from baseline |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Borrowed native baseline | 4 | 353.95 | baseline |
| Pre-resolved field plan | 5 | 367.11 | +3.72% |
| Pointer-identity key/value cache | 3 | 400.29 | +13.09% |
| Split and inline repeated-value fast path | 2 | **421.65** | **+19.13%** |

Adjacent two-run ablations measured the pointer cache 9.14% above the field
plan and the final inline split 7.37% above the pointer-cache version. Every
run accepted 60,736,279 records, skipped the same malformed record, and wrote
78,686,129 durable bytes.

### Full 80 GiB result

| Metric | Borrowed baseline | Structural optimized | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Source bytes | 85,899,345,920 | 85,899,345,920 | identical |
| Accepted records | 607,363,459 | 607,363,459 | identical |
| Native wire bytes | 66,592,152,397 | 66,592,152,397 | identical |
| Ingest elapsed | 229.309520 s | **192.491413 s** | **16.06% lower** |
| Source throughput | 357.25 MiB/s | **425.58 MiB/s** | **19.13% higher** |
| Durable bytes | 780,372,593 | 780,372,593 | identical total |
| Compression ratio | 110.0748x | 110.0748x | identical |
| Peak server RSS | 2,205,552 KiB | 2,226,716 KiB | 0.96% higher |
| Cold-ready upper bound | 9.848 s | **9.730 s** | 1.20% lower |
| Recovered query mean | 12.211 ms | 12.214 ms | effectively unchanged |
| Recovered query p99 | 12.925 ms | **12.500 ms** | 3.29% lower |

The full storage trees have different pack boundaries because the native
multi-request run is host-scheduled and the faster consumer changes durable
pack filling. The authoritative total is identical, cold recovery validated
the store without any checksum error, and exact queries returned the same ten
records.
The deterministic single-worker structural ablation above is the byte-level
wire-format equivalence check.

### Final single-core profile

The final 8 GiB DWARF profile collected 10,538 cycle samples with zero lost and
sustained 401.30 MiB/s under sampling, 23.35% above the retained baseline
profile. The separate counter run sustained 385.06 MiB/s.

| Counter/category | Borrowed baseline | Structural optimized | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Cycles/source-byte | 10.031 | **8.422** | **-16.04%** |
| Instructions/source-byte | 23.686 | **19.357** | **-18.28%** |
| IPC | 2.36 | 2.30 | -2.54% |
| Context switches/second | 12,375 | **12,026** | -2.82% |
| Indexed structural encoding, inclusive | 56.86% | **50.27%** | lower share of a faster run |
| Field lane, inclusive | 19.49% | **9.29%** | -52.33% relative |
| Generic `record_field`, self | 6.42% | absent | removed |
| Repeated-value slow path, inclusive | 5.08% old counter | **3.40%** | hot hits are inlined |

At the measured 3.473 GHz clock, the optimized counter run still uses about
2.60 times the CPU budget available at 1 GiB/s. The next targets are native
UTF-8/cursor validation, BLAKE3 transport verification, Pco timestamps, and
the one-`spawn_blocking`-task-per-request execution model. Zstandard remains a
smaller target.

All 100 library tests, every binary test, formatting, and Clippy with warnings
denied passed on macOS and Linux.

Adam used framework revision
`bd1c4ba7eff99a5f324a5434b1a9d23444e32582`; its framework checkout was

host-scheduled benchmark evidence, not exact task-schedule replay.

## ClickHouse analytical compatibility gate

The authenticated Arrow/RowBinary scan boundary and stock ClickHouse evaluator path pass
13 exact-result query classes: row count, native-map grouping, conditional and
exact aggregates, windows, CTE/array aggregation, self-join, timestamp plus map
filtering, mixed pushed/residual filtering, disjunction, missing-map grouping,
missing-map empty-default equality, alias/subquery evaluation, and aggregate
combinators. The expanded matrix passed locally on ClickHouse 26.6.1.1193 and
on Adam with the pinned `26.3.17.56` image.

On 2026-08-04, the full six-relation matrix also passed against a live,
cross-signal fixture on the exact official `26.3.17.56` evaluator: 13 log
cases plus 12 span/event/link/metric/exemplar and correlation cases produced
byte-identical output against ClickHouse `Memory` snapshots. This is a
functional compatibility result, not an 80 GiB throughput or latency result.

The supported integration now uses stock ClickHouse's `URL` engine against the
Rust RowBinary endpoint. No ClickHouse source patch, custom binary, or C++
adapter is part of the product. Explicit endpoint parameters retain native
index pushdown for callers that construct the source URL; arbitrary SQL
predicates remain residual ClickHouse work.

Run the functional matrix with the official pinned image:

```bash
SHARD_TELEMETRY_CLICKHOUSE_TOKEN_FILE=/run/secrets/shardtelemetry-clickhouse-token \
CLICKHOUSE_IMAGE=clickhouse/clickhouse-server@sha256:REPLACE_WITH_PINNED_DIGEST \
SHARD_TELEMETRY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100/shardtelemetry/api/v1/clickhouse/scan \
SHARD_TELEMETRY_TENANT=fake \
scripts/run-clickhouse-telemetry-compatibility.sh
```

The 80 GiB cold/warm head-to-head follows only after that functional gate
passes. `scripts/run-clickhouse-head-to-head.sh` must sequentially query the
same loaded ShardTelemetry corpus through the stock URL table and the retained
`benchmark.logs` MergeTree snapshot on CPUs 0-15, with equal `max_threads`,
cache state, result checksums, and query ordering.
